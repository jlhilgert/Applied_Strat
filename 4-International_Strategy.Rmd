![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.11.36.png)

Figure 8.1 identifies the five main themes of this chapter, with international strategy as the core. The themes are as follows:

- Internationalisation drivers. Drivers include market demand, the potential for cost advantages, government pressures and inducements and the need to respond to competitor moves. Given the risks and costs of international strategy, managers need to know that the drivers are strong to justify adopting an international strategy in the first place.
- Geographical and firm-specific advantages. I n international competition, advantages might come from firm-specific and geographical advantages. Firm-specific advantages are the unique strategic capabilities proprietary to an organisation as discussed in Chapter 3. Geographical advantages might come both from the geographic location of the original business and from the international configuration of their value network.
- International strategy. If drivers and advantages are sufficiently strong to merit an international strategy, then a range of strategic approaches are opened up, from the simplest export strategies to the most complex global strategies.
- Market selection. Having adopted the broad approach to international strategy, the question next is which country markets to prioritise and which to steer clear of. The issues here range from the economic to the cultural and political.
- Entry mode. Finally, once target countries are selected, managers have to determine how they should enter each particular market. Again, export is a simple place to start, but there are licensing, franchising, joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary alternatives to consider as well.

The chapter distinguishes between international strategy and global strategy. International strategy refers to a range of options for operating outside an organisation’s country of origin. Global strategy is only one kind of international strategy. Global strategy involves high coordination of extensive activities dispersed geographically in many countries around the world.

This chapter keeps open alternative options to full global strategy.

## INTERNATIONALISATION DRIVERS

Given internationalisation’s complexity, international strategy should be underpinned by a careful assessment of trends in each particular market. George Yip provides a framework for analysing ‘drivers of globalisation’. In the terms of this chapter, these globalisation drivers can be thought of as ‘internationalisation drivers’ more generally. In this book, therefore, Yip’s globalisation framework sees international strategy potential as determined by market drivers, cost drivers, government drivers and competitive drivers (see Figure 8.2).

In more detail, the four drivers are as follows:

- Market drivers. A critical facilitator of internationalisation is standardisation of market characteristics. There are three components underlying this driver. First, the presence of similar customer needs and tastes : for example, the fact that in most societies consumers have similar needs for easy credit has promoted the worldwide spread of a handful of credit card companies such as Visa. Second is the presence of global customers : for example, car component companies have become more international as their customers, such as Toyota or Ford, have internationalised, and required standardised components for all their factories around the world. Finally, transferable marketing promotes market globalisation: brands such as Coca-Cola are still successfully marketed in very similar ways across the world.
- Cost drivers. Costs can be reduced by operating internationally. Again, there are three main elements to cost drivers. First, increasing volume beyond what a national market might support can give scale economie s, both on the production side and in purchasing of supplies. Companies from smaller countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan tend therefore to become proportionately much more international than companies from the USA, which have a vast market at home. Scale economies are particularly import ant in industries with high product development costs, as in the aircraft industry, where initial costs need to be spread over the large volumes of international markets. Second, internationalisation is promoted where it is possible to take advantage of variations in countryspecific differences. Thus it makes sense to locate the manufacture of clothing in Africa or Bangladesh where labour is still considerably cheaper, but to keep design activ ities in cities such as New York, Paris, Milan or London, where fashion expertise is concentrated. The third element is favourable logistics, or the costs of moving products or services across borders relative to their final value. From this point of view, microchips are easy to source internationally, while bulky materials such as assembled furniture are harder.
- Government drivers. There are three main factors here that facilitate internationalisation. First, reduction of barriers to trade and investment has accelerated internationalisation. During the last couple of decades national governments have reduced restrictions on both flow of goods and capital. The World Trade Organization has been instrumental in reducing trade barriers globally. 4 Similarly, the emergence of regional economic integration partnerships like the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community has promoted this development. No government, however, allows complete economic openness and it typically varies widely from industry to industry, with agriculture and high-tech industries related to defence likely to be particularly sensitive. The liberalisation and adoption of free markets in many countries around the globe have also encouraged international trade and investments. This of course includes the collapse of the Soviet Union and liberalisation of Eastern Europe, China’s free market reforms and market-based reforms in numerous Asian and South American economies. A third important government factor is technology standardisation. Compatible technical standards make it easier for companies to access different markets as they can enter many markets with the same product or service without adapting to local idiosyncratic standards.
- Competitive drivers. These relate specifically to globalisation as an integrated worldwide strategy rather than simpler international strategies. These have two elements. First, interdependence between country operations increases the pressure for global coordination. For example, a business with a plant in Mexico serving both the US and the Japanese markets has to coordinate carefully between the three locations: surging sales in one country, or a collapse in another, will have significant knock-on effects on the other countries. The second element relates directly to competitor strategy. The presence of globalised competitors increases the pressure to adopt a global strategy in response because competitors may use one country’s profits to cross-subsidise their operations in another. A company with a loosely coordinated international strategy is vulnerable to globalised competitors, because it is unable to support country subsidiaries under attack from targeted, subsidised competition. The danger is of piecemeal withdrawal from countries under attack, and the gradual undermining of any overall economies of scale that the international player may have started with.

## GEOGRAPHIC SOURCES OF ADVANTAGE

There are two principal opportunities available: the exploitation of particular locational advantages, often in the company’s home country, and sourcing advantages overseas via an international value system.

### Locational advantage: Porter’s Diamond

Countries and regions within them, and organisations originating in those, often benefit from competitive advantages grounded in specific local conditions. They become associated with specific types of enduring competitive advantage: for example, the Swiss in private banking, the northern Italians in leather and fur fashion goods, and the Taiwanese in laptop computers.

Figure 8.3 Porter’s Diamond – the determinants of national advantages

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.12.59.png)

Michael Porter's four interacting determinants of locational advantage work as follows:

- Factor conditions. These refer to the ‘factors of production’ that go into making a product or service (i.e. raw materials, land and labour). Factor condition advantages at a national level can translate into general competitive advantages for national firms in international markets. For example, the linguistic ability of the Swiss has traditionally provided a significant advantage to their banking industry. Cheap energy has traditionally provided an advantage for the North American aluminium industry.
- Home demand conditions. The nature of the domestic customers can become a source of competitive advantage. Dealing with sophisticated and demanding customers at home helps train a company to be effective overseas. For example, America’s long distances have led to competitive strength in very large truck engines. Sophisticated local customers in France and Italy have helped keep their local fashion industries at the leading edge for many decades.
- Related and supporting industries. Local ‘clusters’ of related and mutually supporting industries can be an important source of competitive advantage. These are often regionally based, making personal interaction easier. In northern Italy, for example, the leather footwear industry, the leatherworking machinery industry and the design services which underpin them group together in the same regional cluster to each other’s mutual benefit. Silicon Valley forms a cluster of hardware, software, research and venture capital organisations which together create a virtuous circle of high-technology enterprise.
- Firm strategy, industry structure and rivalry. The characteristic strategies, industry structures and rivalries in different countries can also be bases of advantage. German companies’ strategy of investing in technical excellence gives them a characteristic advantage in engineering industries and creates large pools of expertise. A competitive local industry structure is also helpful: if too dominant in their home territory, local organisations can become complacent and lose advantage overseas. Some domestic rivalry can actually be an advantage, therefore. For example, the long-run success of the Japanese car companies is partly based on government policy sustaining several national players (unlike in the United Kingdom, where they were all merged into one) and the Swiss pharmaceuticals industry became strong in part because each company had to compete with several strong local rivals.

For individual organisations, however, the value of Porter’s Diamond is to identify the extent to which they can build on home-based advantages to create competitive advantage in relation to others internationally.

### The international value system

The sources of geographic advantage need, however, not be purely domestic. In addition, as companies continue to internationalise, the country of origin becomes relatively less important for competitive advantage. Here the different skills, resources and costs of countries around the world can be systematically exploited in order to locate each element of the value chain in that country or region where it can be conducted most effectively and efficiently.

Different locational advantages can be identified:

- Cost advantages include labour costs, transportation and communications costs and taxation and investment incentives. Labour costs are important. American and European firms, for example, have moved much of their software programming tasks to India where a computer programmer costs an American firm about one quarter of what it would pay for a worker with comparable skills in the USA. As wages in India have risen, some IT firms have started to move work to even more low-cost locations such as Thailand and Vietnam.
- Unique local capabilities may allow an organisation to enhance its competitive advantage. Gradually value-creating and innovative activity becomes geographically dispersed across multiple centres of excellence within multinational organisations. 10 For example, leading European pharmaceuticals company GSK has R&D laboratories in Boston and the Research Triangle in North Carolina in order to establish research collaborations with the prominent universities and hospitals in those areas. Internationalisation, therefore, is increasingly not only about exploiting an organisation’s existing capabilities in new national markets, but about developing strategic capabilities by drawing on capabilities found elsewhere in the world.
- National market characteristics can enable organisations to develop differentiated product offerings aimed at different market segments. American guitar-maker Gibson, for example, complements its US-made products with often similar, lower-cost alternatives produced in South Korea under the Epiphone brand. However, because of the American music tradition, Gibson’s high-end guitars benefit from the reputation of still being ‘made in the USA’.

## INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIES

Values and attitudes, cultures, laws, institutions and economics differ across countries, which imply differences in customer preferences, product and service standards, regulations and human resources that all need to be addressed. These two opposing pressures – global integration vs local responsiveness – put contradictory demands on an organisation’s international strategy. High pressure for global integration implies an increased need to concentrate and coordinate operations globally. In contrast, high pressure for local responsiveness implies a greater need to disperse operations and adapt to local demand.

This key problem is sometimes referred to as the global–local dilemma : the extent to which products and services may be standardised across national boundaries or need to be adapted to meet the requirements of specific national markets.

This section introduces four different kinds of international strategy, based on strategic choices about this balance (see Figure 8.4).

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.13.47.png)

The four basic international strategies are:
- Export strategy. This strategy leverages home country capabilities, innovations and products in different foreign countries. It is advantageous when both pressures for global integration and local responsiveness are low, as shown in Figure 8.4. Companies that have distinctive capabilities together with strong reputation and brand names often follow this strategy with success.
- Multi-domestic strategy. This is a strategy that maximises local responsiveness. It is based on different product or service offerings and operations in each country depending on local market conditions and customer preferences. Each country is treated differently with a considerable autonomy for each country manager to best meet the needs of the local markets and customers in that particular country. As in the export strategy, this strategy is similarly loosely coordinated internationally. The organisation becomes a collection of relatively independent units with value chain activities adapted to specific local conditions. This multi-domestic approach is particularly appropriate when there are strong benefits to adapting to local needs and when there are limited efficiency gains from integration. It is common in food and consumer product industries where local idiosyncratic preferences are significant. Marketing-driven companies often pursue this type of strategy. The disadvantages of a multi-domestic strategy include manufacturing inefficiencies, a proliferation of costly product and service variations and risks towards brand and reputation if national practices become too diverse.
- Global strategy. This is a strategy that maximises global integration. In this strategy the world is seen as one marketplace with standardised products and services that fully exploits integration and efficiency in operations. The focus is on capturing scale economies and exploiting location economies worldwide with geographically dispersed value chain activities being coordinated and controlled centrally from headquarters. In these respects this strategy is the exact opposite to the multi-domestic strategy. A global strategy is most beneficial when there are substantial cost or quality efficiency benefits from standardisation and when customer needs are relatively homogeneous across countries. It is a common strategy for commodities or commodity-like products. The drawback of the global strategy is reduced flexibility due to standardisation that limits possibilities to adapting activities and products to local conditions.
- Transnational strategy. This is the most complex strategy that tries to maximise both responsiveness and integration. Its aim is to unite the key advantages of the multi-domestic and global strategies while minimising their disadvantages. In addition, it maximises learning and knowledge exchange between dispersed units. In this strategy products and services and operational activities are, subject to minimum efficiency standards, adapted to local conditions in each country. In contrast to the multi-domestic strategy, however, this strategy also leverages learning and innovation across units in different countries. The value chain configuration includes an intricate combination of centralised manufacturing to increase efficiency combined with distributed assembly and local adaptations. Coordination is neither centralised at home nor dispersed in foreign countries, but encourages knowledge flows from wherever ideas and innovations come from. The major advantage of this strategy is its capacity to support efficiency and effectiveness while at the same time being able to serve local needs and leverage learning across units. However, while it is argued that transnational strategies are becoming increasingly necessary, many firms find it difficult to implement given its complexity and the fundamental trade-off between integration and responsiveness.

Global integration and local responsiveness are matters of degree rather than sharp distinctions. Moreover, choices between them will be influenced by changes in the internationalisation drivers introduced earlier. It is rare that companies adopt a pure form of international strategy; instead they often blend approaches and are located somewhere between the four strategies.

Often regions (e.g. Europe or North America) play a larger role in international strategy than individual countries or global expansion. Thus many multinationals compromise between local and global logics by opting for regional strategies. The aim of this strategy is to attain some of the economic efficiency and location advantages of more global strategies while simultaneously reaching local adaptation advantages. Regions are treated as relatively homogenous markets with value chain activities concentrated within them. Sales data suggest that many multinational companies follow this type of strategy focused on one or two regions including the triad of the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement and/or Japan/Asia.

## MARKET SELECTION AND ENTRY

Having decided on an international strategy built on significant sources of competitive advantage and supported by strong internationalisation drivers, managers need next to decide which countries to enter.

### Market characteristics

At least four elements of the PESTEL framework are particularly important in comparing countries for entry:

- Political. Political environments vary widely between countries and can alter rapidly. Russia since the fall of communism has seen frequent swings for and against private foreign enterprise. Governments can of course create significant opportunities for organisations. It is important, however, to determine the level of political risk before entering a country. Toyota, for example, found itself the subject of an unexpected consumer boycott in China because of political tensions over a territorial dispute between China and Japan. There is also a risk that governments simply take over companies.
- Economic. Key comparators in deciding entry are levels of gross domestic product and disposable income which help in estimating the potential size of the market. Fast-growth economies obviously provide opportunities, and in developing economies such as China and India growth is translating into an even faster creation of a high-consumption middle class. At the same time entirely new high-growth markets are opening up in Africa including Nigeria and Ghana.
- Social. Social factors will clearly be important, for example the availability of a well-trained workforce or the size of demographic market segments – old or young – relevant to the strategy. Cultural variations also need to be considered, for instance in defining tastes in the marketplace.
- Legal. Countries vary widely in their legal regime, determining the extent to which businesses can enforce contracts, protect intellectual property or avoid corruption. Similarly, policing will be important for the security of employees, a factor that in the past has deterred business in some African countries.

A common procedure is to rank country markets against each other on criteria such as these and then to choose the countries for entry that offer the highest relative scores. However, Pankaj Ghemawat from Spain’s IESE Business School has pointed out that what matters is not just the attractiveness of different countries relative to each other, but also the compatibility of the countries with the internationalising firm itself.

Ghemawat’s ‘CAGE framework’ measures the match between countries and companies according to four dimensions of distance, reflected by the letters of the acronym. Thus the CAGE framework emphasises the importance of cultural, administrative, geographical and economic distance, as follows:

- Cultural distance. The distance dimension here relates to differences in language, ethnicity, religion and social norms. Cultural distance is not just a matter of similarity in consumer tastes, but extends to important compatibilities in terms of managerial behaviours. Figure 8.5 draws on the GLOBE survey of 17,000 managers from 62 different societal cultures around the world to contrast specifically the orientations of American and Chinese managers on some key cultural dimensions. According to this GLOBE survey, American managers appear to be typically more risk-taking, while Chinese managers are more autonomous. One way to shrink distance is through cooperation with local partners.
- Administrative and political distance. Here distance is in terms of incompatible administrative, political or legal traditions. Colonial ties can diminish difference, so that the shared heritage of France and its former West African colonies creates certain understandings that go beyond linguistic advantages. Institutional weaknesses – for example, slow or corrupt administration – can open up distance between countries. So too can political differences: Chinese companies are increasingly able to operate in parts of the world that American companies are finding harder, for example parts of the Middle East and Africa.
- Geographical distance. This is not just a matter of the kilometres separating one country from another, but involves other geographical characteristics of the country such as size, seaaccess and the quality of communications infrastructure. Transport infrastructure can shrink or exaggerate physical distance. France is much closer to large parts of Continental Europe than to the United Kingdom, because of the barrier presented by the English Channel and the latter relatively poor road and rail infrastructure.
- Economic. The final element of the CAGE framework refers particularly to wealth distances. There are of course huge disparities in wealth internationally: around the world, there are 4 billion people beneath the poverty income threshold of less than \$2 a day. 22 Multinationals from rich countries are typically weak at serving such very poor consumers. However, these rich-country multinationals are losing out on large markets if they only concentrate on the wealthy elites overseas. University of Michigan academic C.K. Prahalad pointed out that the aggregated wealth of those at the ‘base of the pyramid’ in terms of income distribution is very substantial: simple mathematics means that those 4 billion below the poverty threshold represent a market of more than \$2,000 bn per year. If rich-country multinationals can develop new capabilities to serve these numerically huge markets, they can bridge the economic distance, and thereby both significantly extend their presence in booming economies such as China and India and bring to these poor consumers the benefits that are claimed for Western goods.

### Competitive characteristics

Author: jlhil Subject: Highlight Date: 2/14/2021 12:19:52 PM Assessing the relative attractiveness of markets by PESTEL and CAGE analyses is only the first step. The second element relates to competition. Here, of course, Michael Porter’s five forces framework can help (see section 2.3). For example, country markets with many existing competitors, powerful buyers (perhaps large retail chains such as in much of North America and Northern Europe) and low barriers to further new entrants from overseas would typically be unattractive. However, an additional consideration is the likelihood of retaliation from other competitors.

Here the likelihood and ferocity of potential competitor reactions are added to the simple calculation of relative country market attractiveness. As in Figure 8.6, country markets can be assessed according to three criteria:

- Market attractiveness t o the new entrant, based on PESTEL, CAGE and five forces analyses, for example. In Figure 8.6, countries A and B are the most attractive to the entrant.
- Defender’s reactiveness, likely to be influenced by the market’s attractiveness to the defender but also by the extent to which the defender is working with a globally integrated, rather than multi-domestic, strategy. A defender will be more reactive if the markets are important to it and it has the managerial capabilities to coordinate its response. Here, the defender is highly reactive in countries A and D.
- Defender’s clout, that is the power that the defender is able to muster in order to fight back. Clout is typically a function of share in the particular market, but might be influenced by connections to other powerful local players, such as retailers or government. In Figure 8.6, clout is represented by the size of the bubbles, with the defender having most clout in countries A, C, D and F.

Figure 8.6 International competitor retaliation

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-23 at 13.32.59.png)

Choice of country to enter can be significantly modified by adding reactiveness and clout to calculations of attractiveness. Relying only on attractiveness, the top-ranked country to enter in Figure 8.6 is country A. Unfortunately, it is also one in which the defender is highly reactive, and the one in which it has most clout. Country B becomes a better international move than A. In turn, country C is a better prospect than country D, because, even though they are equally attractive, the defender is less reactive. One surprising result of taking defender reactiveness and clout into account is the re-evaluation of country E: although ranked fifth on simple attractiveness, it might rank second overall if competitor retaliation is allowed for. The defender may choose to retaliate in other markets than the targeted one, counter-attacking wherever it has the clout to do damage to the aggressor.

### Entry modes

Internationalisation typically brings organisations into unfamiliar territory, requiring managers to learn new ways of doing business. 24 The staged international expansion model proposes a sequential process whereby companies gradually increase their commitment to newly entered markets, as they build market knowledge and capabilities. However, the gradualism of staged international expansion is now challenged by two phenomena:

- ‘Born-global firms’, in other words new small firms that internationalise rapidly at early stages in their development. 25 New technologies now help small firms link up to international sources of expertise, supply and customers worldwide. For such firms, waiting till they have enough international experience is not an option: international strategy is a condition of existence. For example, companies like Twitter and Instagram internationalised quickly from being small start-ups.
- Emerging-country multinationals also often move quickly through entry modes. Prominent examples are the Chinese white-goods multinational Haier, the Indian pharmaceuticals company Ranbaxy Laboratories and Mexico’s Cemex cement company mentioned above. 26 Such companies typically develop unique capabilities in their home market that then need to be rolled out quickly worldwide before competitors catch up.

The two principles of competitive advantage and tradability do suggest the following broad guidelines for entry mode (Figure 8.7):

- Export is the baseline option, and is suitable where the product or services are easily transported from country to country and where the home-based competitive advantages are sufficiently broad to minimise reliance on local companies.
- License or franchise the product or service where competitive advantages are too narrow to go it alone, but the legal environment is such that licensees and franchisees can be relied on not to abuse their contracts, under-perform on standards or steal the intellectual property.
- Joint ventures work where competitive advantages are narrow, but local licensees or franchisees cannot be trusted with intellectual property or long-term performance. A joint venture involving shared ownership gives the foreign company more direct control and ensures that the local partner has an interest in maximising the value of the common enterprise rather than solely its own standalone interests.
- Wholly owned subsidiary is an attractive route where competitive advantages are sufficiently broad not to depend on local partners, but where nevertheless transport difficulties rule out simple export. Such wholly owned subsidiaries can be via new greenfield investments (as for example many Japanese car companies have entered European markets) or via acquisition, where the integration of a local firm completes the breadth of competitive advantage required.

## INTERNATIONALISATION AND PERFORMANCE

<span style='color:darkred'><b>Maybe not that important</b></span>

Just as for product and service diversity discussed in section 7.4 the relationship between internationalisation and performance has been extensively researched. 28 Some of the main findings from such research are these:

- An inverted U-curve. While the potential performance benefits of internationalisation are substantial, in that it allows firms to realise economies of scale and scope and benefit from the locational advantages available in countries around the globe, the combination of diverse locations and diverse business units also gives rise to high levels of organisational complexity. At some point, the costs of organisational complexity may exceed the benefits of internationalisations. Accordingly, theory and the balance of evidence suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between internationalisation and performance (similar to the findings on product/ service diversification shown in section 7.4), with moderate levels of internationalisation leading to the best results. However, Yip’s research on large British companies suggests that managers may be getting better at internationalisation, with substantially internationalised firms actually seeing performance improving to the point where international sales are above about 40 per cent of total sales. 29 Experience and commitment to internationalisation may be able to deliver strong performance for highly internationalised firms.
- Service-sector disadvantages. A number of studies have suggested that, in contrast to firms in the manufacturing sector, internationalisation may not lead to improved performance for service-sector firms. There are three possible reasons for such an effect. First, the operations of foreign service firms in some sectors (such as accountants or banks) remain tightly regulated and restricted in many countries; second, due to the intangible nature of services, they are often more sensitive to cultural differences and require greater adaptation than manufactured products which may lead to higher initial learning costs; third, the services typically require a significant local presence and reduce the scope for the exploitation of economies of scale in production compared to manufacturing firms.
- Internationalisation and product diversity. A n important question to consider is the interaction between internationalisation and product/service diversification. Compared to single-business firms it has been suggested that product-diversified firms are likely to do better from international expansion because they have already developed the necessary skills and structures for managing internal diversity. 31 At the other end of the spectrum there is general consensus that firms that are highly diversified in terms of both product and international markets are likely to face excessive costs of coordination and control leading to poor performance. As many firms have not yet reached levels of internationalisation where negative effects outweigh possible gains and because of current scepticism with regard to the benefits of high levels of product diversification, many companies currently opt for reducing their product diversity while building their international scope.

## ROLES IN AN INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO

The complexity of the strategies followed by organisations such as General Electric or Unilever can result in highly differentiated networks of subsidiaries with a range of distinct strategic roles. Subsidiaries may play different roles according to the level of local resources and capabilities available to them and the strategic importance of their local environment (see Figure 8.8):

- Strategic leaders are subsidiaries that not only hold valuable resources and capabilities, but are also located in countries that are crucial for competitive success because of, for example, the size of the local market or the accessibility of key technologies. Japanese and European subsidiaries in the USA often play this role. Increasingly, subsidiaries are seen as playing important strategic roles with entrepreneurial potential for the whole multinational organisation. Subsidiaries and subunits are either assigned strategic roles or take auto nomous strategic initiatives.
- Contributors are subsidiaries located in countries of lesser strategic significance, but with sufficiently valuable internal capabilities to nevertheless play key roles in a multinational organisation’s competitive success. The Australian subsidiary of the Swedish telecommunications firm Ericsson played such a role in developing specialised systems for the firm’s mobile phone business.
- Implementers, though not contributing substantially to the enhancement of a firm’s competitive advantage, are important in the sense that they help generate vital financial resources. In this sense, they are similar to the ‘cash cows’ of the Boston Consulting Group matrix. The danger is that they turn into the equivalent of ‘dogs’.
- Black holes are subsidiaries located in countries that are crucial for competitive success but with low-level resources or capabilities. This is a position many subsidiaries of American and European firms found themselves in over long periods in Japan. They have some of the characteristics of ‘question marks’ in the Boston Consulting Group matrix, requiring heavy investment (like an astrophysicist’s black hole, sucking matter in). Possibilities for overcoming this unattractive position include the development of alliances and the selective and targeted development of key resources and capabilities.
