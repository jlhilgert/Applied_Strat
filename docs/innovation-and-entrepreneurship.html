<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><mark>The two main themes that link innovation and entrepreneurship are timing and relationships</mark> (see Figure 9.1). <mark>Timing decisions include when to be first-mover or fast second in innovation; when, and if, an innovation will reach its tipping point, the point where demand takes off; and, for an entrepreneurial new venture, when founders should finally exit their enterprise.</mark> <mark>The other theme is relationships. Creating innovations or new organisations is very rarely done alone. Successful innovation and entrepreneurship are typically done through relationships. These relationships come in many forms: sometimes relationships between organisations and their customers; sometimes relationships between big business and small start-ups; sometimes between business and ‘social entrepreneurs’.</mark></p>

<div id="technology-push-or-market-pull" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Technology push or market pull</h3>
<p>People often see innovation as driven by technology. In the pure version of <mark>this technology push view, it is the new knowledge created by technologists or scientists that pushes the innovation process.</mark> Research and development laboratories produce new products, processes or services and then hand them over to the rest of the organisation to manufacture, market and distribute.</p>
<p><mark>An alternative approach to innovation is market pull. Market pull reflects a view of innovation that goes beyond invention and sees the importance of actual use. In many sectors users, not producers, are common sources of important innovations.</mark> In designing their innovation strategies, therefore, organisations should listen in the first place to users rather than their own scientists and technologists.</p>
<p><mark>There are two prominent but contrasting approaches to market pull:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Lead users: according to MIT professor Eric Von Hippel, in many markets it is lead users who are the principal source of innovation.</mark> In medical surgery, top surgeons often adapt existing surgical instruments in order to carry out new types of operation. In extreme sports such as snowboarding or windsurfing, it is leading sportspeople who make the improvements necessary for greater performance. <mark>In this view, then, it is the pull of market experts that is responsible for innovation.</mark> Managers need to build close relationships with lead users such as the best surgeons or sporting champions. Marketing and sales functions identify the lead users of a field and then scientists and technologists translate their inventive ideas into commercial products, processes or services that the wider market can use.</li>
<li><mark>Frugal innovation: at the other end of the user continuum is the pull exerted by ordinary consumers, particularly the poor in emerging markets.</mark> Rather than the expensive research-intensive model of the traditional technology push approach, frugality is the guiding principle here. Frugal innovation involves sensitivity to poor people’s real needs. <mark>Responding not only to these users’ lack of money, but also to the tough conditions in which they live, frugal innovation typically emphasises low cost, simplicity, robustness and easy maintenance.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p>The lead user and frugal innovation approaches are <mark>opposite ends of a spectrum, one elitist, the other basic. Many organisations will choose somewhere in between.</mark> But fundamentally both approaches share a key insight: innovations do not just come from scientific research, but can be pulled by users in the external market.</p>
</div>
<div id="product-or-process-innovation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Product or process innovation</h3>
<p>Just as managers must manage the balance between technology and market pull, so must they determine the relative emphasis to place on product or process innovation. <mark>Product innovation relates to the final product (or service) to be sold, especially with regard to its features; process innovation relates to the way in which this product is produced and distributed, especially with regard to improvements in cost or reliability.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Usually the first stages of an industry are dominated by product innovation based on new features. </mark>Industries eventually coalesce around a dominant design, the standard configuration of basic features. <mark>Once such a dominant design is established, innovation switches to process innovation, as competition shifts to producing the dominant design as efficiently as possible.</mark> Finally, the cycle is liable to start again, as some significant innovation challenges the dominant design: in the case of cars recently, the emergence of electric power. Figure 9.2 provides a general model of the relationship between product and process innovation over time.</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 Product and process innovation</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.17.18.png" /></p>
<p>The model has several strategic implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>New developing industries typically favour product innovation, as competition is still around defining the basic features of the product or service.</li>
<li>Maturing industries typically favour process innovation, as competition shifts towards efficient production of a dominant design of product or service.</li>
<li><mark>Small new entrants typically have the greatest opportunity when dominant designs are either not yet established or beginning to collapse. E.g. Model T and Tesla respectively.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Large incumbent firms typically have the advantage during periods of dominant design stability, when scale economies and the ability to roll out process innovations matter most.</mark></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="open-or-closed-innovation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Open or closed innovation</h3>
<p>This ‘closed’ model of innovation contrasts with the newer ‘open model’ of innovation. <mark>Open innovation involves the deliberate import and export of knowledge by an organisation in order to accelerate and enhance its innovation.</mark> The motivating idea of open innovation is that exchanging ideas openly is likely to produce better products more quickly than the internal, closed approach. Speedier and superior products are what are needed to keep ahead of the competition, not obsessive secrecy.</p>
<p>Open innovation typically requires careful support of collaborators. In particular, dominant firms may need to exercise platform leadership. Platform leadership refers to how large firms consciously nurture independent companies through successive waves of innovation around their basic technological ‘platform’.</p>
<p><mark>The balance between open and closed innovation depends on three key factors:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Competitive rivalry. In highly rivalrous industries, partners are liable to behave opportunistically and steal innovations. Closed innovation is better where such rivalrous behaviours can be anticipated.</mark></li>
<li><mark>One-shot innovation. Opportunistic behaviour is more likely where innovation involves a major shift in technology, likely to put winners substantially ahead and losers permanently behind. Open innovation works best where innovation is more continuous, so encouraging more reciprocal behaviour over time.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Tight-linked innovation. Where technologies are complex and tightly interlinked, open innovation risks introducing damagingly inconsistent elements, with knock-on effects throughout the product range.</mark> Apple, with its smoothly integrated range of products from computers to phones, has therefore tended to prefer closed innovation in order to protect the quality of the user experience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="technological-or-business-model-innovation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Technological or business model innovation</h3>
<p><mark>Many successful innovations do not rely simply upon new science or technology, but involve reorganising into new combinations all the elements of a business. Here innovators are creating whole new business models</mark>, bringing customers, producers and suppliers together in new ways, with or without new technologies. A business model describes how an organisation manages incomes and costs through the structural arrangement of its activities.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> <mark>For the ultra-cheap airline Ryanair, business model innovation involved the generation of revenues via direct sales through the internet, thereby cutting out intermediary travel agents, while also using cheap secondary airports.</mark> Internet sales and cheaper airports were much more important than technological innovation. The internet technology itself was not Ryanair’s creation and it had the same aeroplanes as most of its competitors. Thus it can be as effective to innovate in terms of business model as in technology.</p>
<p><mark>These frameworks point managers and entrepreneurs to two basic areas for potential innovation:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>The product. A new business model may redefine what the product or service is and how it is produced.</mark> In terms of the value chain specifically, this concerns technology development, procurement, inbound logistics, operations and procurement.</li>
<li><mark>The selling. A new business model may change the way in which the organisation generates its revenues, with implications for selling and distribution.</mark> In terms of the value chain, this concerns outbound logistics, marketing, sales and service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business model innovation is not just a matter of technology, but involves a wide range of the firm’s activities. Thus the business model concept helps managers and entrepreneurs consider science and technology as just one part of the whole package that contributes to innovation. Innovation can be drawn from all parts of the value chain, not just technology development. Indeed, <mark>radical technological innovation often requires business model innovation too.</mark></p>

</div>
<div id="innovation-diffusion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> <span style="background-color:#6bf66c;">¥</span> INNOVATION DIFFUSION</h2>
<p>Diffusion is the process by which innovations spread among users. Since innovation is typically expensive, its commercial attractiveness can hinge on the pace extent and speed – at which the market adopts new products and services. This pace of diffusion is something managers can influence from both the supply and demand sides, and which they can also model using the S-curve.</p>
<div id="the-pace-of-diffusion" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> The pace of diffusion</h3>
<p>On the supply side, pace is determined by product features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of improvement in performance above current products (from a customer’s perspective) that provides incentive to change. Managers need to make sure innovation benefits sufficiently exceed costs.</li>
<li>Compatibility w ith other factors, for example digital TV becomes more attractive as the broadcasting networks change their programmes to that format. Managers and entrepreneurs therefore need to ensure appropriate complementary products and services are in place.</li>
<li>Complexity, either in the product itself or in the marketing methods being used to commercialise the product: unduly complex pricing structures, as with many financial service products such as pensions, discourage consumer adoption. Simple pricing structures typically accelerate adoptions.</li>
<li>Experimentation – the ability to test products before commitment to a final decision – either directly or through the availability of information about the experience of other customers. Free initial trial periods are often used to encourage diffusion.</li>
<li>Relationship management, in other words how easy it is to get information, place orders and receive support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and entrepreneurs need to put in place an appropriate relationship management process to assist new users. On the demand side, simple affordability is of course key. Beyond this, there are three further factors that tend to drive the pace of diffusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market awareness. Many potentially successful products have failed through lack of consumer awareness – particularly when the promotional effort of the innovator has been confined to ‘push’ promotion to its intermediaries (e.g. distributors).</li>
<li>Network effects refer to the way that demand growth for some products accelerates as more people adopt the product or service. Once a critical mass of users have adopted, it becomes of much greater benefit, or even necessary, for others to adopt it too.</li>
<li>Customer propensity to adopt: the distribution of potential customers from early-adopter groups (keen to adopt first) through to laggards (typically indifferent to innovations). Innovations are often targeted initially at early-adopter groups – typically the young and the wealthy – in order to build the critical mass that will encourage more laggardly groups – the poorer and older – to join the bandwagon.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-diffusion-s-curve" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> <span style="background-color:#6bf66c;">The diffusion S-curve</span></h3>
<p>The pace of diffusion is typically not steady. <mark>Successful innovations often diffuse according to a broad S-curve pattern.</mark> The shape of the S-curve reflects a process of initial slow adoption of innovation, followed by a rapid acceleration in diffusion, leading to a plateau representing the limit to demand (Figure 9.3). The height of the S-curve shows the extent of diffusion; the shape of the S-curve shows the speed.</p>
<p>Figure 9.3 The diffusion S-curve</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.18.19.png" /></p>
<p><mark>Diffusion rarely follows exactly this pattern, but none the less the S-curve can help managers and entrepreneurs anticipate forthcoming issues. In particular, the S-curve points to four likely decision points:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Timing of the ‘tipping point’. Demand for a new product or service may initially be slow but then reaches a tipping point when it explodes onto a rapid upwards path of growth. A tipping point is where demand for a product or service suddenly takes off, with explosive growth.</mark> Tipping points are particularly explosive where there are strong network effects: in other words, where the value of a product or service is increased the more people in a network use them. Being aware of a possible tipping point ahead can help managers plan investment in capacity and distribution.</li>
<li><mark>Timing of the plateau. The S-curve also alerts managers to a likely eventual slowdown in demand growth.</mark> Again, it is tempting to extrapolate existing growth rates forwards, especially when they are highly satisfactory. But heavy investment immediately before growth turns down is likely to leave firms with over-capacity and carrying extra costs in a period of industry shake-out.</li>
<li><mark>Extent of diffusion. The S-curve does not necessarily lead to one hundred per cent diffusion among potential users. Most innovations fail to displace previous-generation products and services altogether.</mark> For example, in music, traditional turntables and LP discs are still preferred over CD and MP3 players by many disc jockeys and music connoisseurs. <mark>A critical issue for managers then is to estimate the final ceiling on diffusion, being careful not to assume that tipping point growth will necessarily take over the whole market.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Timing of the ‘tripping point’. The tripping point is the opposite of the tipping point, referring to when demand suddenly collapses. Of course, decline is usually more gradual.</mark> However, the presence of network effects can lead to relatively few customer defections setting off a market landslide. Such landslides are very hard to reverse.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="innovators-and-followers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> INNOVATORS AND FOLLOWERS</h2>
<p><mark>A key choice for managers is whether to lead or to follow in innovation.</mark> The S-curve concept seems to promote leadership in innovation. First-movers get the easy sales of early fast growth and can establish a dominant position. On the other hand, many first-movers fail. Even the powerful Microsoft failed with its tablet computer launched in 2001. Nine years later, Apple swept the market with its iPad tablet computer.</p>
<div id="first-mover-advantages-and-disadvantages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> First-mover advantages and disadvantages</h3>
<p><mark>There are five potentially more robust first-mover advantages:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Experience curve benefits accrue to first-movers</mark>, as their rapid accumulation of experience with the innovation gives them greater expertise than late entrants still relatively unfamiliar with the new product, process or service</li>
<li><mark>Scale benefits are typically enjoyed by first-movers</mark>, as they establish earlier than competitors the volumes necessary for mass production and bulk purchasing, for example.</li>
<li><mark>Pre-emption of scarce resources is an opportunity for first-movers</mark>, as late-movers will not have the same access to key raw materials, skilled labour or components, and will have to pay dearly for them.</li>
<li><mark>Reputation can be enhanced by being first</mark>, especially since consumers have little ‘mind-space’ to recognise new brands once a dominant brand has been established in the market.</li>
<li><mark>Buyer switching costs can be exploited by first-movers</mark>, by locking in their customers with privileged or sticky relationships that later challengers can only break with difficulty. Switching costs can be increased by establishing and exploiting a technological standard.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Late-movers have two principal potential advantages:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Free-riding. Late-movers can imitate technological and other innovation at less expense than originally incurred by the pioneers.</mark> Research suggests that the costs of imitation are only 65 per cent of the cost of innovation.</li>
<li><mark>Learning. Late-movers can observe what worked well and what did not work well for innovators.</mark> They may not make so many mistakes and be able to get it right first time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="first-or-second" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> First or second?</h3>
<p>London Business School’s Costas Markides and Paul Geroski argue that <mark>the most appropriate response to innovation, especially radical innovation, is often not to be a first-mover, but to be a ‘fast second’.</mark></p>
<p><mark>There are three contextual factors to consider in choosing between innovating and imitating:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Capacity for profit capture.</mark> David Teece of the University of California Berkeley emphasises <mark>the importance of innovators being able to capture for themselves the profits of their innovations.</mark> This depends on the ease with which followers can imitate. <mark>The likelihood of imitation depends on two primary factors.</mark>
<ul>
<li><mark>First, imitation is likely if the innovation is in itself easy to replicate.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Second, imitation is facilitated if intellectual property rights are weak</mark>, for example where patents are hard to define or defend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><mark>Complementary assets. Possession of the assets or resources necessary to scale up the production and marketing of the innovation is often critical.</mark> Many small European biotech start-up companies face this constraint in the pharmaceuticals industry, where marketing and distribution channels in the USA, the world’s largest market, are essential complementary assets, but are dominated by the big established pharmaceutical companies. Small European start-ups can find themselves obliged either to sell out to a larger company with the complementary marketing and distribution assets, or to license their innovation to them on disadvantageous terms. <mark>For organisations wishing to remain independent and to exploit their innovations themselves, there is little point in investing heavily to be first-mover in the absence of the necessary complementary assets.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Fast-moving arenas. Where markets or technologies are moving very fast, and especially where both are highly dynamic, first-movers are unlikely to establish a durable advantage.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and entrepreneurs need, therefore, to assess future market and technological dynamism in calculating the likely value of first-mover advantage.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-incumbents-response" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.3</span> The incumbent’s response</h3>
<p>As Harvard Business School’s Clay Christensen has shown, <mark>the problem for incumbents can be twofold.</mark>
- <mark>First, managers can become too attached to existing assets and skills</mark>: understandably, as these are what their careers have been built on.
- <mark>Second, relationships between incumbent organisations and their customers can become too close.</mark> Existing customers typically prefer incremental improvements to current technologies, and are unable to imagine completely new technologies. <mark>Incumbents are reluctant to ‘cannibalise’ their existing business by introducing something radically different.</mark></p>
<p>The challenge for incumbents, however, is disruptive innovation. A disruptive innovation creates substantial growth by offering a new performance trajectory that, even if initially inferior to the performance of existing technologies, has the potential to become markedly superior.</p>
<p>Figure 9.4 Disruptive innovation</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.19.18.png" /></p>
<p><mark>Incumbents can follow two policies to help keep them responsive to potentially disruptive innovations:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Develop a portfolio of real options. Companies that are most challenged by disruptive innovations tend to be those built upon a single business model and with one main product or service.</mark> Columbia’s Rita McGrath and Wharton’s Ian MacMillan recommend that companies build portfolios of real options in order to maintain organisational dynamism. <mark>Real options are limited investments that keep opportunities open for the future</mark> (for a more technical discussion, see section 11.3.2). Establishing an R&amp;D team in a speculative new technology or acquiring a small start-up in a nascent market would both be examples of real options, each giving the potential to scale up fast should the opportunity turn out to be substantial. McGrath and MacMillan’s portfolio identifies three different kinds of options (Figure 9.5). Options where the market is broadly known, but the technologies are still uncertain, are positioning options: a company might want several of these, to ensure some position in an important market, by one technology or another. On the other hand, a company might have a strong technology, but be very uncertain about appropriate markets, in which case it would want to bet on several scouting options to explore which markets are actually best. Finally, a company would want some stepping stone options, very unlikely in themselves to work, but possibly leading to something more promising in the future. Even if they do not turn a profit, stepping stones should provide valuable learning opportunities. <mark>An important principle for options is: ‘Fail fast, fail cheap, try again.’</mark></li>
<li><mark>Develop new venture units. New ventures, especially when undertaken from a real options perspective, may need protection from the usual systems and disciplines of a core business. It would make no sense to hold the managers of a real option strictly accountable for sales growth and profit margin: their primary objective is preparation and learning.</mark> For this reason, large incumbent organisations often establish relatively <mark>autonomous ‘new venture units’</mark>, sometimes called new venture divisions, which can nurture new ideas or acquire fledgling businesses with a longer-term view. The risks of such autonomous venture units are twofold. First, the new units may be denied resources that the core business could easily supply, such as branding or management information systems. Second, innovation becomes isolated from the core business: for the core organisation, innovation is something that somebody else does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 9.5 Portfolio of innovation options</p>

<div id="entrepreneurship-and-relationships" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> <span style="background-color:#6bf66c;">ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RELATIONSHIPS</span></h2>
<p>Given the difficulties of large incumbent firms in fostering innovation, many would conclude that the best approach is to start up a new venture from scratch.</p>
<div id="stages-of-entrepreneurial-growth" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1</span> Stages of entrepreneurial growth</h3>
<p><mark>The entrepreneurial life cycle progresses through start-up, growth, maturity and exit.</mark></p>
<p>Figure 9.6 Stages of entrepreneurial growth and typical challenges</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.20.27.png" /></p>
<p><mark>Each of these four stages raises key questions for entrepreneurs:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Start-up. There are many challenges at this stage, but one key question with implications for both survival and growth are sources of capital.</mark> Loans from family and friends are common sources of funds, but these are typically limited and, given the new-business failure rate, likely to lead to embarrassment. Bank loans and credit cards can provide funding too, and there is often government funding, especially for new technologies or economically disadvantaged social groups or geographical areas. Venture capitalists are specialised investors in new ventures, especially when there is some track record. Venture capitalists usually insist on a seat on the venture’s board of directors and may instal their preferred managers. Venture capitalist backing has been shown to significantly increase the chances of a venture’s success, but venture capitalists typically accept only about one 1 in 400 propositions put to them.</li>
<li><mark>Growth. A key challenge for growth ventures is management. Entrepreneurs have to be ready to move from doing to managing. Typically this transition occurs as the venture grows beyond about 20 employees. Many entrepreneurs make poor managers</mark>: if they had wanted to be managers, they would probably be working in a large corporation in the first place. The choice entrepreneurs have to make is whether to rely on their own managerial skills or to bring in professional managers.</li>
<li><mark>Maturity. The challenge for entrepreneurs at this stage is retaining their enthusiasm and commitment and generating new growth. This is a period when entrepreneurship changes to intrapreneurship, the generation of new ventures from inside the organisation.</mark> An important option is usually <mark>diversification into new business areas</mark>, a topic dealt with in Chapter 7. Amazon.com in the USA has moved from book-selling to automotive parts, groceries and clothing. When generating new ventures at this stage, it is critical to recall the odds on success. <mark>Research suggests that many small high-tech firms fail to manage the transition to a second generation of technology, and that it is often better at this point simply to look for exit.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Exit. Exit refers to departure from the venture, either by the founding entrepreneurs or by the original investors, or both. At the point of exit, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will seek to release capital as a reward for their input and risk-taking.</mark> Entrepreneurs may consider <mark>three prime routes to exit.</mark> A simple <mark>trade sale of the venture to another company is a common route.</mark> Thus in 2012 the founders of photo-sharing site Instagram sold their company to Facebook for $300 m cash and $700 m worth of Facebook shares just two years after starting the company. <mark>Another exit route for highly successful enterprises is an initial public offering (IPO), the sale of shares to the public,</mark> for instance on the American NASDAQ exchange. IPOs usually involve just a portion of the total shares available, and may thus allow entrepreneurs to continue in the business and provide funds for further growth. In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg raised $16 bn in Facebook’s IPO, while retaining for himself 28 per cent ownership of the company. <mark>It is often said that good entrepreneurs plan for their exit right from start-up, and certainly venture capitalists will insist on this.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Entrepreneurs who have successfully exited a first venture often become serial entrepreneurs.</mark> Serial entrepreneurs are people who set up a succession of enterprises, investing the capital raised on exit from earlier ventures into new growing ventures.</p>
</div>
<div id="entrepreneurial-strategies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> Entrepreneurial strategies</h3>
<p><mark>There are two characteristics of entrepreneurial businesses that can be particularly influential for strategy choice:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Resource scarcity</mark>: start-up enterprises usually face very considerable resource constraints, in terms of finances and managerial capacity especially. <mark>Entrepreneurial businesses therefore need to be highly selective in their strategic moves, careful not to waste scarce resources on too many initiatives. They should be extra cautious about competing head-to-head with wealthier players, where there is a risk of wars of attrition.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Relative invisibility</mark>: as new and small players, entrepreneurial businesses are typically less visible to larger, established businesses. <mark>Lower visibility means that entrepreneurial businesses face less risk of prompt incumbent retaliation for any aggressive strategic moves.</mark> Entrepreneurial businesses may therefore have more time to press forward their attack before meeting any counter-attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>This combination of resource disadvantage and invisibility advantage influences business strategy choices differently according to the kind of market the entrepreneur is operating in:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>New markets: entrepreneurial firms in new markets, where products and customer segments are not yet settled, generally do best by exploring potential opportunities fast.</mark> Speed of entry is important given the difficulties of competing against larger players in the same product or segment. <mark>Even if enjoying a first-mover advantage, it can be better to abandon a market position that is beginning to attract more powerful competitors, and to explore new opportunities instead.</mark> In fast-growing markets, large businesses are typically better able to assemble the resources necessary to take advantage of increasing scale. For entrepreneurial firms, therefore, timing is vital: picking the right moments to enter and then to retreat are the crucial decisions.</li>
<li><mark>Established markets: in more established markets, where large firms are already present, entrepreneurial firms are more successful if they can find niches that are still not occupied.</mark> These niches are often better supplied by low-cost adaptations of existing products rather than by radical innovations, which are liable to be too risky and expensive for a small-scale enterprise. The key is generally not to attack large incumbents directly and to rely on their inattention to small-scale moves to delay any competitive imitation on their part.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="entrepreneurial-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.3</span> Entrepreneurial relationships</h3>
<p><mark>Relationships with large companies can be important right from the start. Often entrepreneurs have worked for large companies beforehand, and continue to use relationships afterwards.</mark> Thus entrepreneurship often involves managing relationships with other companies, especially big companies. <mark>Three concepts are particularly influential here:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Corporate venturing. As in section 9.4.3, many large corporations have developed corporate venture units that invest externally in new ventures as safeguards against disruptive innovations and potential drivers of future growth. Entrepreneurs gain by accessing not just capital but also knowledge of large-company thinking in their domain and contacts with other members of the large company’s network.</mark> It is crucial that both entrepreneurs and corporate venture capitalists <mark>continuously monitor the expectations behind the investment</mark>: is the investment more profit-driven in terms of expecting good financial returns or is it more strategic, in the sense of being about technological or market development? <mark>Shifting expectations on the part of the corporate venture capitalist can lead to the disruption of longer-term plans by the entrepreneurial new venture.</mark> Companies such as Ericsson and Diageo have even closed down their venture units entirely.</li>
<li>&lt;markSpin-offs (or spin-outs). These in a sense go in the opposite direction to corporate venturing, involving the generation of small innovative units from larger organisations.&gt;</mark> Companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor are famous for generating many successful spin-offs, including Intel, AMD and LSI Logic. Spin-off relationships can be mutually supportive, with the larger parent organisation offering the new venture seed capital and access to its marketing or technological resources. <mark>The spin-off gains the flexibility of being independent, while the parent retains a stake in any future success. Sometimes parents will seek to buy out the spin-off entrepreneurs, and reintegrate the venture into the original organisation.</mark> For entrepreneurial spin-off companies, therefore, there are potential benefits to managing a constructive relationship with their original parent.</li>
<li><mark>Ecosystems. Following the ‘open innovation’ approach (section 9.2.3), high-technology companies such as Cisco, IBM and Intel often foster ‘ecosystems’ of smaller companies. These ecosystems are communities of connected suppliers, agents, distributors, franchisees, technology entrepreneurs and makers of complementary products.</mark> Thus Apple has created an ecosystem of apps around its iPhone. The superiority of Apple’s app offering gives it a competitive advantage over Nokia or BlackBerry, for example. Moreover, Apple app writers get the benefit of a large and often lucrative market. Small entrepreneurial firms wishing to participate in such ecosystems have to be skilled in managing relationships with powerful technological leaders</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="social-entrepreneurship" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.4</span> Social entrepreneurship</h3>
<p><mark>Social entrepreneurs are individuals and groups who create independent organisations to mobilise ideas and resources to address social problems, typically earning revenues but on a not-for-profit basis.</mark> Independence and revenues generated in the market give social entrepreneurs the flexibility and dynamism to pursue social problems that pure public-sector organisations are often too bureaucratic, or too politically constrained, to tackle.</p>
<p><mark>This wide range of initiatives raises at least three key choices for social entrepreneurs:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Social mission. For social entrepreneurs, the social mission is primary. The social mission can embrace two elements: end objectives and operational processes.</mark> For example, the Grameen Bank has the end objective of reducing rural poverty, especially for women. The process is empowering poor people’s own business initiatives by providing micro-credit at a scale and to people that conventional banks would ignore.</li>
<li><mark>Organisational form. Many social enterprises take on cooperative forms, involving their employees and other stakeholders on a democratic basis and thus building commitment and channels for ideas.</mark> This form of organisation raises the issue of which stakeholders to include, and which to exclude. <mark>Cooperatives can also be slow to take hard decisions. Social enterprises therefore sometimes take more hierarchical charity or company forms of organisation.</mark> Cafédirect, the fair-trade beverages company, even became a publicly listed company, paying its first dividend to shareholders in 2006.</li>
<li><mark>Business model. Social enterprises typically rely to a large extent on revenues earned in the marketplace, not just government subsidy or charitable donations.</mark> Housing associations collect rents, micro-credit organisations charge interest and fair-trade organisations sell produce. <mark>Social entrepreneurs are no different to other entrepreneurs, therefore, in having to design an efficient and effective business model.</mark> This business model might involve innovative changes in the value chain. Thus fair-trade organisations have often become much more closely involved with their suppliers than commercial organisations, for example advising farmers on agriculture and providing education and infrastructure support to their communities. Illustration 9.5 shows how mine-clearing venture APOPO is struggling to find a viable business model.</li>

<p><mark>Social entrepreneurs, just like other entrepreneurs, often have to forge relationships with large commercial companies. Harvard Business School’s Rosabeth Moss Kanter points out that the benefits to large companies can go beyond a feel good factor and attractive publicity. She shows that involvement in social enterprise can help develop new technologies and services, access new pools of potential employees, and create relationships with government and other agencies that can eventually turn into new markets. Kanter concludes that large companies should develop clear strategies with regard to social entrepreneurship, not treat it as ad hoc charity.</mark></p>
