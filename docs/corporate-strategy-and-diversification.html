Chapter 7 - CORPORATE STRATEGY AND DIVERSIFICATION</p>
<div id="introduction-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Organisations may choose to enter many new product and market areas (see Figure PII.1 in Part II introduction). Tata Group, one of India’s largest companies, began as a trading organisation and soon moved into hotels and textiles. Since that time Tata has diversified further into steel, motors, consultancy, technologies, tea, chemicals, power, communications. As organisations add new units and capabilities, their strategies may no longer be solely concerned with competitive strategy in one market space at the business level, but with choices concerning different businesses or markets.</p>
<p>Another way of increasing the scope of an organisation is vertical integration, discussed in Section 7.5. It allows an organisation to act as an internal supplier or a customer to itself (as for example an oil company supplies its petrol to its own petrol stations). The organisation may decide to outsource certain activities – to ‘dis-integrate’ by subcontracting an internal activity to an external supplier – as this may improve organisational efficiency. The scope of the organisation may therefore be adjusted through growth or contraction.</p>
</div>
<div id="strategy-directions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> STRATEGY DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p>The Ansoff product/market growth matrix 1 is a corporate strategy framework for generating four basic directions for organisational growth: see Figure 7.2 for an adapted version. Typically an organisation starts in the zone around point A, the top left-hand corner of Figure 7.2. According to Ansoff, the organisation may choose between penetrating still further within its existing sphere (staying in zone A) or increasing its diversity along the two axes of increasing novelty of markets or increasing novelty of products. This process of increasing the diversity of the range of products and/or markets served by an organisation is known as ‘diversification’. Diversification involves increasing the range of products or markets served by an organisation. Related diversification involves expanding into products or services with relationships to the existing business. Thus on Ansoff’s axes the organisation has two related diversification strategies available: moving to zone B, developing new products for its existing markets or moving to zone C by bringing its existing products into new markets. In each case, the further along the two axes, the more diversified is the strategy. Alternatively, the organisation can move in both directions at once, following a conglomerate diversification strategy with altogether new markets and new products (zone D). Thus conglomerate (unrelated) diversification involves diversifying into products or services with no relationships to existing businesses.</p>
<p>Figure 7.2 Corporate strategy directions</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.06.34.png" /></p>
<p>Ansoff’s axes can be used effectively in brainstorming strategic options, checking that options in all four zones have been properly considered.</p>
<div id="market-penetration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Market penetration</h3>
<p>For a simple, undiversified business, the most obvious strategic option is often increased penetration of its existing market, with its existing products. Market penetration implies increasing share of current markets with the current product range.</p>
<p>However, organisations seeking greater market penetration may face two constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retaliation from competitors. In terms of the five forces ( section 2.3.1), increasing market penetration is likely to exacerbate industry rivalry as other competitors in the market defend their share. Increased rivalry might involve price wars or expensive marketing battles, which may cost more than any market-share gains are actually worth. The dangers of provoking fierce retaliation are greater in low-growth markets, as any gains in volume will be much more at the expense of other players. Where retaliation is a danger, organisations seeking market penetration need strategic capabilities that give a clear competitive advantage. In low-growth or declining markets, it can be more effective simply to acquire competitors. Some companies have grown quickly in this way.</li>
<li>Legal constraints. Greater market penetration can raise concerns from official competition regulators concerning excessive market power. Most countries have regulators with the powers to restrain powerful companies or prevent mergers and acquisitions that would create such excessive power. In the United Kingdom, the Competition Commission can investigate any merger or acquisition that would account for more than 25 per cent of the national market, and either halt the deal or propose measures that would reduce market power. The European Commission has an overview of the whole European market and can similarly intervene. For example, when the German T-Mobile and French Orange companies proposed to merge their UK mobile phone operations in 2010, the European Commission insisted that the merged companies should divest a quarter of their combined share of the key mobile phone 1800 MHz spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Market penetration may also not be an option where economic constraints are severe, for instance during a market downturn or public-sector funding crisis.</p>
</div>
<div id="product-development" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Product development</h3>
<p>Product development is where organisations deliver modified or new products (or services) to existing markets. This can involve varying degrees of diversification along the horizontal axis of Figure 7.2. For Apple, developing its products from the original iPod, through iPhone to iPad involved little diversification: although the technologies differed, Apple was targeting the same customers and using very similar production processes and distribution channels.</p>
<p>Despite the potential for benefits from relatedness, product development can be an expensive and high-risk activity for at least two reasons:
- New strategic capabilities. Product development strategies typically involve mastering new processes or technologies that are unfamiliar to the organisation. Success is likely to depend on a willingness to acquire new technological capabilities, to engage in organisational restructuring and new marketing capabilities to manage customer perceptions. Thus product development typically involves heavy investments and can have high risk of project failures.
- Project management risk. Even within fairly familiar domains, product development projects are typically subject to the risk of delays and increased costs due to project complexity and changing project specifications over time. An extreme example is Boeing’s Dreamliner 787 aircraft: making innovative use of carbon-fibre composites, the Dreamliner had a history of delays even before launch in 2010, and required $2.5 bn (~ £1.75 bn) write-offs due to cancelled orders.</p>
</div>
<div id="market-development" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Market development</h3>
<p>Product development can be risky and expensive. Market development can be more attractive by being potentially cheaper and quicker to execute. Market development involves offering existing products to new markets.</p>
<p>Market development takes two basic forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>New users. Here an example would be aluminium, whose original users, packaging and cutlery manufacturers are now supplemented by users in aerospace and automobiles.</li>
<li>New geographies. The prime example of this is internationalisation, but the spread of a small retailer into new towns would also be a case.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, it is essential that market development strategies be based on products or services that meet the critical success factors of the new market (see section 2.4.3). Strategies based on simply off loading traditional products or services in new markets are likely to fail.</p>
</div>
<div id="conglomerate-diversification" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Conglomerate diversification</h3>
<p>Conglomerate (or unrelated) diversification takes the organisation beyond both its existing markets and its existing products (i.e. zone D in Figure 7.2). In this sense, it radically increases the organisation’s scope.</p>
<p>However, conglomerate strategies are often not trusted by many observers because there are no obvious ways in which the businesses can work together to generate additional value, over and above the businesses remaining on their own. In addition, there is often an additional bureaucratic cost of the managers at headquarters who control them. For this reason, conglomerate companies’ share prices can suffer from what is called the ‘conglomerate discount’ – in other words, a lower valuation than the combined individual constituent businesses would have on their own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="diversification-drivers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> DIVERSIFICATION DRIVERS</h2>
<p>Four potentially value-creating drivers for diversification are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploiting economies of scope. Economies of scope refer to efficiency gains through applying the organisation’s existing resources or competences to new markets or services.4 If an organisation has under-utilised resources or competences that it cannot effectively close or sell to other potential users, it is efficient to use these resources or competences by diversification into a new activity. In other words, there are economies to be gained by extending the scope of the organisation’s activities. For example, many universities have large resources in terms of halls of residence, which they must have for their students but which are under-utilised out of term-time. These halls of residence are more efficiently used if the universities expand the scope of their activities into conferencing and tourism during holiday periods.</li>
<li>Stretching corporate management competences (‘dominant logics’). This is a special case of economies of scope, and refers to the potential for applying the skills of talented corporatelevel managers (referred to as ‘corporate parenting skills’ in section 7.6) to new businesses. The dominant logic is the set of corporate-level managerial competences applied across the portfolio of businesses. 5 Corporate-level managers may have competences that can be applied even to businesses not sharing resources at the operating-unit level. Thus the French luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH includes a wide range of businesses – from champagne, through fashion, jewellery and perfumes, to financial media – that share very few operational resources or business-level competences. However, LVMH creates value for these specialised companies by applying corporate-level competences in developing classic brands and nurturing highly creative people that are relevant to all its individual businesses.</li>
<li>Exploiting superior internal processes. Internal processes within a diversified corporation can often be more efficient than external processes in the open market. This is especially the case where external capital and labour markets do not yet work well, as in many developing economies. In these circumstances, well-managed conglomerates can make sense, even if their constituent businesses do not have operating relationships with each other. For example, China has many conglomerates because it is able to mobilise internal investment, develop managers and exploit networks in a way that standalone Chinese companies, relying on imperfect markets, cannot.</li>
<li>Increasing market power. Being diversified in many businesses can increase power vis-à-vis competitors in at least two ways. First, having the same wide portfolio of products as a competitor increases the potential for mutual forbearance. The ability to retaliate across the whole range of the portfolio acts to discourage the competitor from making any aggressive moves at all. Two similarly diversified competitors are thus likely to forbear from competing aggressively with each other. Second, having a diversified range of businesses increases the power to cross-subsidise one business from the profits of the others. On the one hand, the ability to cross-subsidise can support aggressive bids to drive competitors out of a particular market. On the other hand, knowing this power to cross-subsidise a particular business, competitors without equivalent power will be reluctant to attack that business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where diversification creates value, it is described as ‘synergistic’. Synergy refers to the benefits gained where activities or assets complement each other so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of the parts (the famous 2 + 2 = 5 equation). Thus a film company and a music publisher would be synergistic if they were worth more together than separately – if the music publisher had the sole rights to music used in the film company productions for instance</p>
<p>Indeed, some drivers for diversification involve negative synergies, in other words value destruction. Three potentially value-destroying diversification drivers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to market decline is one common but doubtful driver for diversification. Rather than let the managers of a declining business invest spare funds in a new business, conventional finance theory suggests it is usually best to let shareholders find new growth investment opportunities for themselves. For example, Kodak (see Illustration 5.5 in Chapter 5), the US photo film corporation, spent billions of dollars on diversification acquisitions such as chemicals, desktop radiotherapy, photocopiers, telecommunications and inkjet printers in order to compensate for market decline in its main product. Many of these initiatives failed and the decline of the core business continued until Kodak went bankrupt. Shareholders might have preferred Kodak simply to hand back the large surpluses generated for decades beforehand rather than spending on costly acquisitions. If shareholders had wanted to invest in the chemicals, telecommunications or printers, they could have invested in the original dominant companies themselves.</li>
<li>Spreading risk a cross a range of markets is another common justification for diversification. Again, conventional finance theory is very sceptical about risk-spreading by diversification. Shareholders can easily spread their risk by taking small stakes in dozens of very different companies themselves. Diversification strategies, on the other hand, are likely to involve a limited range of fairly related markets. While managers might like the security of having more than one market, shareholders typically do not need each of the companies they invest in to be diversified as well – they would prefer managers to concentrate on managing their core business as well as they can. However, conventional finance theory does not apply to private businesses, where the owners have a large proportion of their assets tied up in their company: here it can make sense to diversify risk across a number of distinct activities, so that if one part is in trouble, the whole business is not pulled down.</li>
<li>Managerial ambition can sometimes drive inappropriate diversification. It is argued that the managers of British banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland (at one point the fifth-largest bank in the world) and HBOS (Britain’s largest housing-lender) promoted strategies of excessive growth and diversification into new markets during the first decade of the twenty-first century. Such growth and diversification gave the managers short-term benefits in terms of managerial bonuses and prestige. But going beyond their areas of true expertise soon brought financial disaster, leading to the nationalisation of RBS and the takeover of HBOS by rival bank Lloyds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="diversification-and-performance" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> DIVERSIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>Researchers generally find that related or limited diversifiers outperform both firms that remain specialised and those that have unrelated or extensively diversified strategies. 10 In other words, the diversificationperformance relationship tends to follow an inverted (or upside-down) U-shape, as in Figure 7.3. The implication is that some diversification is good – but not too much.</p>
<p>Figure 7.3 Diversity and performance</p>

</div>
<div id="vertical-integration" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> VERTICAL INTEGRATION</h2>
<p>As well as diversification, another direction for corporate strategy can be vertical integration. Vertical integration describes entering activities where the organisation is its own supplier or customer. Thus it involves operating at another stage of the value network.</p>
<div id="forward-and-backward-integration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Forward and backward integration</h3>
<p>Vertical integration can go in either of two directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backward integration refers to development into activities concerned with the inputs into the company’s current business (i.e. they are further back in the value network). For example, the acquisition by a car manufacturer of a component supplier would be a backward integration move.</li>
<li>Forward integration refers to development into activities concerned with the outputs of a company’s current business (i.e. are further forward in the value network). For a car manufacturer, forward integration would be into car retail, repairs and servicing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus vertical integration is like diversification in increasing corporate scope. The difference is that it brings together activities up and down the same value network, while diversification typically involves more or less different value networks. However, because realising synergies involves bringing together different value networks, diversification (especially related diversification) is sometimes also described as horizontal integration. For example, a company diversified in cars, trucks and buses could find benefits in integrating aspects of the various design or component-sourcing processes. The relationship between horizontal integration and vertical integration is depicted in Figure 7.4.</p>
<p>Figure 7.4 Diversification and integration options: car manufacturer example</p>

<p>Vertical integration is often favoured because it seems to ‘capture’ more of the profits in a value network. The car manufacturer gains the retailer’s profits as well. However, it is important to be aware of two dangers. First, vertical integration involves investment. Expensive investments in activities that are less profitable than the original core business will be unattractive to shareholders because they are reducing their average or overall rate of return on investment. Second, even if there is a degree of relatedness through the value network, vertical integration is likely to involve quite different strategic capabilities. Thus car manufacturers who forwardly integrate into car service and repair have found that managing networks of small service outlets is very different to managing large manufacturing plants.</p>

<div id="to-integrate-or-to-outsource" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> To integrate or to outsource?</h3>
<p>Where a part of vertically integrated operations is not adding value to the overall business, it may be replaced through outsourcing or subcontracting. Outsourcing is the process by which activities previously carried out internally are subcontracted to external suppliers. Specialists in a particular activity are likely to have superior capabilities than an organisation for which that particular activity is not a central part of its business. A specialist IT contractor is usually better at IT than the IT department of a steel company.</p>
<p>Transaction cost economics therefore offers the following advice: if there are few alternative suppliers, if activities are complex and likely to change, and if there are significant investments in specific assets, then it is likely to be better to vertically integrate rather than outsource.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> VALUE CREATION AND THE CORPORATE PARENT</h2>
<div id="value-adding-and-value-destroying-activities-of-corporate-parents" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Value-adding and value-destroying activities of corporate parents</h3>
<p>Corporate parents need to demonstrate that they create more value than they cost. Companies whose shares are traded freely on the stock markets face a further challenge. They must demonstrate they create more value than any other rival corporate parent could create. Failure to do so is likely to lead to a hostile takeover or break-up.</p>
<div id="value-adding-activities" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1.1</span> Value-adding activities</h4>
<p>There are five main types of activity by which a corporate parent can add value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Envisioning. The corporate parent can provide a clear overall vision or strategic intent for its business units. 14 This vision should guide and motivate the business unit managers in order to maximise corporation-wide performance through commitment to a common purpose.</li>
<li>Facilitating synergies. The corporate parent can facilitate cooperation and sharing across the business units, so improving the synergies from being within the same corporate organisation. This can be achieved through incentives, rewards, and remuneration schemes.</li>
<li>Coaching. The corporate parent can help business unit managers develop strategic capabilities, by coaching them to improve their skills and confidence.</li>
<li>Providing central services and resources. The centre is obviously a provider of capital for investment. The centre can also provide central services such as treasury, tax and human resource advice, which if centralised can have sufficient scale to be efficient and to build up relevant expertise. This leverage can be helpful in brokering with external bodies, such as government regulators, or other companies in negotiating alliances.</li>
<li>Intervening. Finally, the corporate parent can also intervene within its business units in order to ensure appropriate performance. The corporate parent should be able to closely monitor business unit performance and improve performance either by replacing weak managers or by assisting them in turning around their businesses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="value-destroying-activities" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1.2</span> Value-destroying activities</h4>
<p>However, there are also three broad ways in which the corporate parent can inadvertently destroy value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding management costs. Most simply, the staff and facilities of the corporate centre are expensive. The corporate centre typically has the best-paid managers and the most luxurious offices. It is the actual businesses that have to generate the revenues that pay for them. If their costs are greater than the value they create, then the corporate centre’s managers are net value-destroying.</li>
<li>Adding bureaucratic complexity. As well as these direct financial costs, there is the ‘bureaucratic fog’ created by an additional layer of management and the need to coordinate with sister businesses. These typically slow down managers’ responses to issues and lead to compromises between the interests of individual businesses.</li>
<li>Obscuring financial performance. One danger in a large diversified company is that the under-performance of weak businesses can be obscured. Weak businesses might be crosssubsidised by the stronger ones. Internally, the possibility of hiding weak performance diminishes the incentives for business unit managers to strive as hard as they can for their businesses: they have a parental safety-net. Externally, shareholders and financial analysts cannot easily judge the performance of individual units within the corporate whole.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-portfolio-manager" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> The portfolio manager</h3>
<p>The portfolio manager operates as an active investor in a way that shareholders in the stock market are either too dispersed or too inexpert to be able to do. In effect, the portfolio manager is acting as an agent on behalf of financial markets and shareholders with a view to extracting more value from the various businesses than they could achieve themselves. Its role is to identify and acquire under-valued assets or businesses and improve them. The portfolio manager might do this, for example, by acquiring another corporation, divesting low-performing businesses within it and intervening to improve the performance of those with potential.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers seek to keep the cost of the centre low, for example by having a small corporate staff with few central services, leaving the business units alone so that their chief executives have a high degree of autonomy. They set clear financial targets for those chief executives, offering high rewards if they achieve them and likely loss of position if they do not.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-synergy-manager" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> The synergy manager</h3>
<p>Obtaining synergy is often seen as the prime rationale for the corporate parent. 17 The synergy manager is a corporate parent seeking to enhance value for business units by managing synergies across business units. Synergies are likely to be particularly rich when new activities are closely related to the core business. In terms of value-creating activities, the focus is threefold: envisioning to build a common purpose; facilitating cooperation across businesses; and providing central services and resources.</p>
<p>For example, at Apple, Steve Jobs’ vision of his personal computers being the digital hub of the new digital lifestyle guided managers across the iMac computer, iPod, iPhone and iPad businesses to ensure seamless connections between the fast-developing offerings.</p>
<p>However, achieving such synergistic benefits involves at least three challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive costs. The benefits in sharing and cooperation need to outweigh the costs of undertaking such integration, both direct financial costs and opportunity costs.</li>
<li>Overcoming self-interest. Managers in the business units have to want to cooperate. Especially where managers are rewarded largely according to the performance of their own particular business unit, they are likely to be unwilling to sacrifice their time and resources for the common good.</li>
<li>Illusory synergies. It is easy to overestimate the value of skills or resources to other businesses. This is particularly common when the corporate centre needs to justify a new venture or the acquisition of a new company. Claimed synergies often prove illusory when managers actually have to put them into practice.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-parental-developer" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4</span> The parental developer</h3>
<p>There are two crucial challenges to managing a parental developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parental focus. Corporate parents need to be rigorous and focused in identifying their unique value-adding capabilities. They should always be asking what others can do better than them, and focus their energy and time on activities where they really do add value. Other central services should typically be outsourced to specialist companies that can do it better.</li>
<li>The ‘crown jewel’ problem. Some diversified companies have business units in their portfolios which are performing well but to which the parent adds little value. These can become ‘crown jewels’, to which corporate parents become excessively attached. The logic of the parental development approach is: if the centre cannot add value, it is just a cost and therefore destroying value. Parental developers should divest businesses 19 they do not add value to, even profitable ones. Funds raised by selling a profitable business can be reinvested in businesses where the parent can add value.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> PORTFOLIO MATRICES</h2>
<div id="the-bcg-or-growthshare-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> The BCG (or growth/share) matrix</h3>
<p>The BCG matrix uses market share and market growth criteria for determining the attractiveness and balance of a business portfolio. High market share and high growth are, of course, attractive. However, the BCG matrix also warns that high growth demands heavy investment, for instance to expand capacity or develop brands. There needs to be a balance within the portfolio, so that there are some low-growth businesses that are making sufficient surplus to fund the investment needs of higher-growth businesses.</p>
<p>Figure 7.6 The growth share (or BCG) matrix</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-23%20at%2012.50.46.png" /></p>
<p>The growth/share axes of the BCG matrix define four sorts of business:</p>
<ul>
<li>A star is a business unit within a portfolio that has a high market share in a growing market. The business unit may be spending heavily to keep up with growth, but high market share should yield sufficient profits to make it more or less self-sufficient in terms of investment needs.</li>
<li>A question mark (or problem child) is a business unit within a portfolio that is in a growing market, but does not yet have high market share. Developing question marks into stars, with high market share, takes heavy investment. Many question marks fail to develop, so the BCG advises corporate parents to nurture several at a time. It is important to make sure that some question marks develop into stars, as existing stars eventually become cash cows and cash cows may decline into dogs.</li>
<li>A cash cow is a business unit within a portfolio that has a high market share in a mature market. However, because growth is low, investments needs are less, while high market share means that the business unit should be profitable. The cash cow should then be a cash provider, helping to fund investments in question marks.</li>
<li>Dogs are business units within a portfolio that have low share in static or declining markets and are thus the worst of all combinations. They may be a cash drain and use up a disproportionate amount of managerial time and company resources. The BCG usually recommends divestment or closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are at least four potential problems with the BCG matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitional vagueness. It can be hard to decide what high and low growth or share mean in particular situations. Managers are often keen to define themselves as ‘high-share’ by defining their market in a particularly narrow way (e.g. by ignoring relevant international markets).</li>
<li>Capital market assumptions. The notion that a corporate parent needs a balanced portfolio to finance investment from internal sources (cash cows) assumes that capital cannot be raised in external markets, for instance by issuing shares or raising loans. The notion of a balanced portfolio may be more relevant in countries where capital markets are under-developed or in private companies that wish to minimise dependence on external shareholders or banks.</li>
<li>Unkind to animals. Both cash cows and dogs receive ungenerous treatment, the first being simply milked, the second terminated or cast out of the corporate home. This treatment can cause motivation problems, as managers in these units see little point in working hard for the sake of other businesses. There is also the danger of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Cash cows will become dogs even more quickly than the model expects if they are simply milked and denied adequate investment.</li>
<li>Ignores commercial linkages. The matrix assumes there are no commercial ties to other business units in the portfolio. For instance, a business unit in the portfolio may depend upon keeping a dog alive. These commercial links are less important in conglomerate strategies, where divestments or closures are unlikely to have knock-on effects on other parts of the portfolio</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-directional-policy-gemckinsey-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> The directional policy (GE–McKinsey) matrix</h3>
<p>Another way to consider a portfolio of businesses is by means of the directional policy matrix 22 which categorises business units into those with good prospects and those with less good prospects. The matrix was originally developed by McKinsey &amp; Co. consultants in order to help the American conglomerate General Electric manage its portfolio of business units. Specifically, the directional policy matrix positions business units according to (i) how attractive the relevant market is in which they are operating, and (ii) the competitive strength of the SBU in that market.</p>
<p>Figure 7.7 Directional policy (GE–McKinsey) matrix</p>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.09.14.png" /></p>
<p>The matrix also offers strategy guidelines given the positioning of the business units, as shown in Figure 7.8. It suggests that the businesses with the highest growth potential and the greatest strength are those in which to invest for growth.</p>
<p>The directional policy matrix is more complex than the BCG matrix. However, it can have two advantages. First, unlike the simpler four-box BCG matrix, the nine cells of the directional policy matrix acknowledge the possibility of a difficult middle ground. Here managers have to be carefully selective. In this sense, the directional policy matrix is less mechanistic than the BCG matrix, encouraging open debate on less clear-cut cases. Second, the two axes of the directional policy matrix are not based on single measures (i.e. market share and market growth).</p>
<p>Business strength can derive from many other factors than market share, and industry attractiveness does not just boil down to industry growth rates. On the other hand, the directional policy matrix shares some problems with the BCG matrix, particularly about vague definitions, capital market assumptions, motivation and self-fulfilling prophecy and ignoring commercial linkages. Overall, however, the value of the matrix is to help managers invest in the businesses that are most likely to pay off.</p>

<div id="the-parenting-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> The parenting matrix</h3>
<p>Businesses may be attractive in terms of the BCG or directional policy matrices, but if the parent cannot add value, then the parent ought to be cautious about acquiring or retaining them. There are two key dimensions of fit in the parenting matrix (see Figure 7.9):</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Feel’. This is a measure of the fit between each business unit’s critical success factors (see section 2.4.3) and the capabilities (in terms of competences and resources) of the corporate parent. In other words, does the corporate parent have the necessary ‘feel’, or understanding, for the businesses it will parent?</li>
<li>‘Benefit’. This measures the fit between the parenting opportunities, or needs, of business units and the capabilities of the parent. Parenting opportunities are about the upside, areas in which good parenting can benefit the business (for instance, by bringing marketing expertise). For the benefit to be realised, of course, the parent must have the right capabilities to match the parenting opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2019.10.26.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 7.9 shows four kinds of business along these two dimensions of feel and benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heartland business units are ones which the parent understands well and can continue to add value to. They should be at the core of future strategy.</li>
<li>Ballast business units are ones the parent understands well but can do little for. They would probably be at least as successful as independent companies. If not divested, they should be spared as much corporate bureaucracy as possible.</li>
<li>Value trap business units are dangerous. They appear attractive because there are opportunities to add value (for instance, marketing could be improved). But they are deceptively attractive, because the parent’s lack of feel will result in more harm than good (i.e. the parent lacks the right marketing skills). The parent will need to acquire new capabilities if it is to be able to move value trap businesses into the heartland. It might be easier to divest to another corporate parent that could add value, and will pay well for the chance.</li>
<li>Alien business units are clear misfits. They offer little opportunity to add value and the parent does not understand them anyway. Exit is definitely the best strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents should concentrate on actual or potential heartland businesses, where there is both high feel and high benefit.</p>
