<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> PESTEL</h3>
<p>In practice, political, economic, social, technological, ecological and legal factors are often interconnected. Nevertheless, going through each of the six PESTEL factors helps raise a wide range of potentially relevant issues, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics highlights the role of the state and other political forces. The state is often important as a direct economic actor, for instance as potential customer, supplier or owner of businesses. But there are also infl uences from various political movements, campaign groups or concerned media.</li>
<li>Social influences include changing cultures and demographics. Thus, for example, the ageing populations in many Western societies create opportunities and threats for both private and public sectors. Changing cultural attitudes can also raise strategic challenges: for example, new ethical attitudes are challenging previously taken-for-granted strategies in the fi nancial services industry.</li>
<li>Technological infl uences refer to infl uences such as the internet, nano technology or the rise of new composite materials. As in the case of the internet in retailing, new technologies open up opportunities for some (e.g. Amazon), while challenging others (traditional stores).</li>
<li>Ecological stands specifically for ‘green’ environmental issues, such as pollution, waste and climate change. Environmental regulations can impose additional costs, for example with pollution controls, but they can also be a source of opportunity, for example the new businesses that emerged around mobile phone recycling.</li>
<li>Legal embraces legislative and regulatory constraints or changes. For example, legal changes might include restrictions on company mergers and acquisitions or new tax treatments of profi ts earned overseas. On the other hand, legal changes can provide opportunities, as for example the liberalisation of foreign investment in India.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../Strategy%20images/Screenshot%202021-02-15%20at%2018.58.28.png" /></p>
<p>Rather than getting overwhelmed by a multitude of details, it is necessary to step back eventually to identify the key drivers for change . Key drivers for change are the environmental factors likely to have a high impact on the future success or failure of strategy. Three concepts are useful for focusing on change while at the same time avoiding too much detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Megatrends are large-scale social, economic, political, ecological or technological changes that are typically slow to form, but which influence many other activities and views, possibly over decades. 3 A megatrend typically shapes other trends. Thus the megatrend towards ageing populations in the West infl uences other trends in social care, retail spending and housing. The megatrend towards rapid economic growth in Asia drives employment patterns in the advanced economies and commodity prices worldwide.</li>
<li>Inflexion points are moments when trends shift in direction, for instance turning sharply upwards or downwards. For example, after decades of stagnation and worse, in the early twenty-first century sub-Saharan Africa may have reached an infl exion point in its economic growth, with the promise of substantial gains in the coming decade or so. Towncentre retailing may also have reached an infl exion point, where the rise of internet shopping and out-of-town retail parks has put urban shopping on a path to signifi cant decline in advanced economies.</li>
<li>Weak signals are advanced signs of future trends and are particularly helpful in identifying infl exion points. Typically these weak signals are unstructured and fragmented bits of information, often perceived by observers as ‘weird’. A weak signal for the worldwide fi nancial crisis that began in 2008 was the rise in mortgage failures in California the previous year. An early weak signal foreshadowing the current success of Asian business schools was the fi rst entry of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology into the Financial Times’ ranking of the top 50 international business schools in the early 2000s. It is important to be alert to weak signals, but it is also easy to be overwhelmed by ‘noise’, the constant stream of isolated and random bits of information without strategic importance. Some signs of truly signifi cant weak signals (as opposed to mere noise) include: the repetition of the signal and the emergence of some kind of pattern; vehement disagreement among experts about the signal’s signifi cance; and an unexpected failure in something that had previously worked very reliably.</li>
</ul>

<div id="building-scenarios" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Building scenarios</h3>
<p>Scenario analyses are carried out to allow for different possibilities and help prevent managers from closing their minds to alternatives. Thus scenarios offer plausible alternative views of how the business environment might develop in the future. The point is not to predict, but to encourage managers to be alert to a range of possible futures.</p>
<p>Rather than incorporating a multitude of factors, the authors focus on two key drivers which (i) have high potential impact; (ii) are uncertain; (iii) are largely independent from each other. These two drivers are the extent to which the world becomes more interconnected and the speed with which society, and fashion, changes.</p>
<p>While there are many ways to carry out scenario analyses, five basic steps are often followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining scenario scope is an important first step. Scope refers to the subject of the scenario analysis and the time span. For example, scenario analyses can be carried out for a whole industry globally, or for particular geographical regions and markets.</li>
<li>Identifying the key drivers for change comes next. Here PESTEL analysis can be used to uncover issues likely to have a major impact upon the future of the industry, region or market. In the fashion industry, key drivers range from demographics to technology. However, the scenario cube suggests two additional criteria are relevant (see Figure 2.3 ): uncertainty , in order to make different scenarios worthwhile; and mutual independence , so that the drivers are capable of producing signifi cantly divergent or opposing outcomes.</li>
<li>Developing scenario ‘stories’ : as in fi lms, scenarios are basically stories. Having selected opposing key drivers for change, it is necessary to knit together plausible stories that incorporate both key drivers and other factors into a coherent whole. Thus in Illustration 2.2 , the ‘Techno-chic’ scenario brings together in a consistent way a more global and integrated culture with a rapid rate of social, technological and economic change. But completing the story of ‘Techno-chic’ would also involve incorporating other consistent factors: for example, rapid development in China and India where low cost becomes supplanted by technological sophistication as source of advantage; free markets to allow rapid growth and international trade; and the creation of an under-class whose cheap labour and outdated technological skills are no longer needed.</li>
<li>Identifying impacts of alternative scenarios on organisations is the next key stage of scenario building. ‘Techno-chic’ might have a very negative impact for many traditional fashion labels and retailers who could not keep up with hi-tech clothing and distribution. On the other hand, ‘Community couture’ could see the strengthening of local craft producers. It is important for an organisation to carry out robustness checks in the face of each plausible scenario and to develop contingency plans in case they happen.</li>
<li>Establishing early warning systems: o nce the various scenarios are drawn up, organisations should identify indicators that might give early warning about the fi nal direction of environmental change, and at the same time set up systems to monitor these. Effective monitoring of well-chosen indicators should facilitate prompt and appropriate responses. In Illustration 2.2 , indicators of a ‘Slow is beautiful’ trend might be low wage growth and rises in religious observance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because debating and learning are so valuable in the scenario-building process, and they deal with such high uncertainty, some scenario experts advise managers to avoid producing just three scenarios. Three scenarios tend to fall into a range of ‘optimistic’, ‘middling’ and ‘pessimistic’. Managers naturally focus on the middling scenario and neglect the other two, reducing the amount of organisational learning and contingency planning. It is therefore typically better to have two or four scenarios, avoiding an easy mid-point. It does not matter if the scenarios do not come to pass: the value lies in the process of exploration and contingency planning that the scenarios set off.</p>

<div id="industries-and-sectors" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS</h2>
<p>An industry is a group of firms producing products and services that are essentially the same. Examples are the automobile industry and the airline industry. Industries are also often described as ‘sectors’, especially in public services (e.g. the health sector or the education sector). Industries and sectors are often made up of several specific markets.</p>
<p>A market is a group of customers for specifi c products or services that are essentially the same (e.g. a particular geographical market). Thus the automobile industry has markets in North America, Europe and Asia, for example.</p>
<div id="competitive-forces-the-five-forces-framework" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Competitive forces – the Five Forces Framework</h3>
<p>Porter’s Five Forces Framework helps identify the attractiveness of an industry in terms of five competitive forces: (i) threat of entry, (ii) threat of substitutes, (iii) power of buyers, (iv) power of suppliers and (v) extent of rivalry between competitors.</p>
<p>These five forces together constitute an industry’s ‘structure’ (see Figure 2.4 ), which is typically fairly stable. For Porter, an attractive industry structure is one that offers good profi t potential. His essential message is that where the fi ve forces are high, industries are not attractive to compete in. Excessive competitive rivalry, powerful buyers and suppliers and the threat of substitutes or new entrants will all combine to squeeze profitability.</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 The Five Forces Framework</p>

<div id="competitive-rivalry" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.1</span> Competitive rivalry</h4>
<p>At the centre of five forces analysis is the rivalry between the existing players – ‘incumbents’ in an industry. The more competitive rivalry there is, the worse it is for incumbents. Competitive rivals are organisations with similar products and services aimed at the same customer group. In the European airline industry, Air France and British Airways are rivals; high-speed trains are a ‘substitute’ (see below).</p>
<p>Five factors tend to define the extent of rivalry in an industry or market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor balance. Where competitors are of roughly equal size there is the danger of intensely rivalrous behaviour as one competitor attempts to gain dominance over others, through aggressive price cuts for example. Conversely, less rivalrous industries tend to have one or two dominant organisations, with the smaller players reluctant to challenge the larger ones directly (e.g. by focusing on niches to avoid the ‘attention’ of the domin ant companies).</li>
<li>Industry growth rate. In situations of strong growth, an organisation can grow with the market, but in situations of low growth or decline, any growth is likely to be at the expense of a rival, and meet with fierce resistance.</li>
<li>High fixed costs. Industries with high fixed costs, perhaps because they require high investments in capital equipment or initial research, tend to be highly rivalrous. Companies will seek to spread their costs (i.e. reduce unit costs) by increasing their volumes: to do so, they typically cut their prices, prompting competitors to do the same and thereby triggering price wars in which everyone in the industry suffers. Similarly, if extra capacity can only be added in large increments (as in many manufacturing sectors, for example a chemical or glass factory), the competitor making such an addition is likely to create short-term over-capacity in the industry, leading to increased competition to use capacity.</li>
<li>High exit barriers. The existence of high barriers to exit – in other words, closure or disinvestment – tends to increase rivalry, especially in declining industries. Excess capacity persists and consequently incumbents fi ght to maintain market share. Exit barriers might be high for a variety of reasons: for example, high redundancy costs or high investment in specifi c assets such as plant and equipment which others would not buy.</li>
<li>Low differentiation. In a commodity market, where products or services are poorly differentiated, rivalry is increased because there is little to stop customers switching between competitors and the only way to compete is on price.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-threat-of-entry" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.2</span> The threat of entry</h4>
<p>How easy it is to enter the industry infl uences the degree of competition. The greater the threat of entry, the worse it is for incumbents in an industry. An attractive industry has high barriers to entry in order to reduce the threat of new competitors.</p>
<p>Five important entry barriers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale and experience. In some industries, economies of scale are extremely important: for example, in the production of automobiles or the advertising of fast-moving consumer goods. Once incumbents have reached large-scale production, it will be very expensive for new entrants to match them and until they reach a similar volume they will have higher unit costs. This scale effect is increased where there are high investment requirements for entry, for example research costs in pharmaceuticals or capital equipment costs in auto mobiles. Barriers to entry also come from experience curve effects that give incumbents a cost advantage because they have learnt how to do things more effi ciently than an inexperienced new entrant could possibly do (see section 6.3.1 ). Until the new entrant has built up equivalent experience over time, it will tend to produce at higher cost.</li>
<li>Access to supply or distribution channels. In many industries manufacturers have had control over supply and/or distribution channels. Sometimes this has been through direct ownership (vertical integration), sometimes just through customer or supplier loyalty. In some industries this barrier has been overcome by new entrants who have bypassed retail distributors and sold directly to consumers through e-commerce (e.g. Dell Computers and Amazon).</li>
<li>Expected retaliation. If an organisation considering entering an industry believes that the retaliation of an existing fi rm will be so great as to prevent entry, or mean that entry would be too costly, this is also a barrier. Retaliation could take the form of a price war or a marketing blitz. Just the knowledge that incumbents are prepared to retaliate is often suffi ciently discouraging to act as a barrier.</li>
<li>Legislation or government action. Legal restraints on new entry vary from patent protection (e.g. pharmaceuticals), to regulation of markets (e.g. pension selling), through to direct government action (e.g. tariffs). Of course, organisations are vulnerable to new entrants if governments remove such protection, as has happened with deregulation of the airline industry.</li>
<li>Differentiation. Differentiation means providing a product or service with higher perceived value than the competition; its importance will be discussed more fully in section 6.3.2. Cars are differentiated, for example, by quality and branding. Steel, by contrast, is by and large a commodity, undifferentiated and therefore sold by the tonne. Steel buyers will simply buy the cheapest. Differentiation reduces the threat of entry because of increasing customer loyalty.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-threat-of-substitutes" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.3</span> The threat of substitutes</h4>
<p>Substitutes are products or services that offer a similar benefi t to an industry’s products or services, but have a different nature. The simple risk of substitution puts a cap on the prices that can be charged in an industry. Thus, although Eurostar has no direct competitors in terms of train services from Paris to London, the prices it can charge are ultimately limited by the cost of flights between the two cities.</p>
<p>There are two important points to bear in mind about substitutes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The price/performance ratio is critical to substitution threats. A substitute is still an effective threat even if more expensive, so long as it offers performance advantages that customers value. Thus aluminium is more expensive than steel, but its relative lightness and its resistance to corrosion give it an advantage in some automobile manufacturing applications. It is the ratio of price to performance that matters, rather than simple price.</li>
<li>Extra-industry effects are the core of the substitution concept. Substitutes come from outside the incumbents’ industry and should not be confused with competitors’ threats from within the industry. The value of the substitution concept is to force managers to look outside their own industry to consider more distant threats and constraints.</li>
</ul>
