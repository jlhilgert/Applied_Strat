## THE MACRO-ENVIRONMENT

### PESTEL

In practice, political, economic, social, technological, ecological and legal factors are often interconnected. Nevertheless, going through each of the six PESTEL factors helps raise a wide range of potentially relevant issues, as follows:

- Politics highlights the role of the state and other political forces. The state is often important as a direct economic actor, for instance as potential customer, supplier or owner of businesses. But there are also influences from various political movements, campaign groups or concerned media.
- Social influences include changing cultures and demographics. Thus, for example, the ageing populations in many Western societies create opportunities and threats for both private and public sectors. Changing cultural attitudes can also raise strategic challenges: for example, new ethical attitudes are challenging previously taken-for-granted strategies in the financial services industry.
- Technological influences refer to influences such as the internet, nano technology or the rise of new composite materials. As in the case of the internet in retailing, new technologies open up opportunities for some (e.g. Amazon), while challenging others (traditional stores).
- Ecological stands specifically for ‘green’ environmental issues, such as pollution, waste and climate change. Environmental regulations can impose additional costs, for example with pollution controls, but they can also be a source of opportunity, for example the new businesses that emerged around mobile phone recycling.
- Legal embraces legislative and regulatory constraints or changes. For example, legal changes might include restrictions on company mergers and acquisitions or new tax treatments of profits earned overseas. On the other hand, legal changes can provide opportunities, as for example the liberalisation of foreign investment in India.

Rather than getting overwhelmed by a multitude of details, it is necessary to step back eventually to identify the key drivers for change. Key drivers for change are the environmental factors likely to have a high impact on the future success or failure of strategy. Three concepts are useful for focusing on change while at the same time avoiding too much detail:

- Megatrends are large-scale social, economic, political, ecological or technological changes that are typically slow to form, but which influence many other activities and views, possibly over decades. 3 A megatrend typically shapes other trends. Thus the megatrend towards ageing populations in the West influences other trends in social care, retail spending and housing. The megatrend towards rapid economic growth in Asia drives employment patterns in the advanced economies and commodity prices worldwide.
- Inflexion points are moments when trends shift in direction, for instance turning sharply upwards or downwards. For example, after decades of stagnation and worse, in the early twenty-first century sub-Saharan Africa may have reached an inflexion point in its economic growth, with the promise of substantial gains in the coming decade or so. Towncentre retailing may also have reached an inflexion point, where the rise of internet shopping and out-of-town retail parks has put urban shopping on a path to significant decline in advanced economies.
- Weak signals are advanced signs of future trends and are particularly helpful in identifying inflexion points. Typically these weak signals are unstructured and fragmented bits of information, often perceived by observers as ‘weird’. A weak signal for the worldwide financial crisis that began in 2008 was the rise in mortgage failures in California the previous year. An early weak signal foreshadowing the current success of Asian business schools was the first entry of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology into the Financial Times’ ranking of the top 50 international business schools in the early 2000s. It is important to be alert to weak signals, but it is also easy to be overwhelmed by ‘noise’, the constant stream of isolated and random bits of information without strategic importance. Some signs of truly significant weak signals (as opposed to mere noise) include: the repetition of the signal and the emergence of some kind of pattern; vehement disagreement among experts about the signal’s significance; and an unexpected failure in something that had previously worked very reliably.

### Building scenarios

Scenario analyses are carried out to allow for different possibilities and help prevent managers from closing their minds to alternatives. Thus scenarios offer plausible alternative views of how the business environment might develop in the future. The point is not to predict, but to encourage managers to be alert to a range of possible futures.

Rather than incorporating a multitude of factors, the authors focus on two key drivers which (i) have high potential impact; (ii) are uncertain; (iii) are largely independent from each other. These two drivers are the extent to which the world becomes more interconnected and the speed with which society, and fashion, changes.

While there are many ways to carry out scenario analyses, five basic steps are often followed:

- Defining scenario scope is an important first step. Scope refers to the subject of the scenario analysis and the time span. For example, scenario analyses can be carried out for a whole industry globally, or for particular geographical regions and markets.
- Identifying the key drivers for change comes next. Here PESTEL analysis can be used to uncover issues likely to have a major impact upon the future of the industry, region or market. In the fashion industry, key drivers range from demographics to technology. However, the scenario cube suggests two additional criteria are relevant (see Figure 2.3): uncertainty, in order to make different scenarios worthwhile; and mutual independence, so that the drivers are capable of producing significantly divergent or opposing outcomes.
- Developing scenario ‘stories’ : as in films, scenarios are basically stories. Having selected opposing key drivers for change, it is necessary to knit together plausible stories that incorporate both key drivers and other factors into a coherent whole. Thus in Illustration 2.2, the ‘Techno-chic’ scenario brings together in a consistent way a more global and integrated culture with a rapid rate of social, technological and economic change. But completing the story of ‘Techno-chic’ would also involve incorporating other consistent factors: for example, rapid development in China and India where low cost becomes supplanted by technological sophistication as source of advantage; free markets to allow rapid growth and international trade; and the creation of an under-class whose cheap labour and outdated technological skills are no longer needed.
- Identifying impacts of alternative scenarios on organisations is the next key stage of scenario building. ‘Techno-chic’ might have a very negative impact for many traditional fashion labels and retailers who could not keep up with hi-tech clothing and distribution. On the other hand, ‘Community couture’ could see the strengthening of local craft producers. It is important for an organisation to carry out robustness checks in the face of each plausible scenario and to develop contingency plans in case they happen.
- Establishing early warning systems: o nce the various scenarios are drawn up, organisations should identify indicators that might give early warning about the final direction of environmental change, and at the same time set up systems to monitor these. Effective monitoring of well-chosen indicators should facilitate prompt and appropriate responses. In Illustration 2.2, indicators of a ‘Slow is beautiful’ trend might be low wage growth and rises in religious observance.

Because debating and learning are so valuable in the scenario-building process, and they deal with such high uncertainty, some scenario experts advise managers to avoid producing just three scenarios. Three scenarios tend to fall into a range of ‘optimistic’, ‘middling’ and ‘pessimistic’. Managers naturally focus on the middling scenario and neglect the other two, reducing the amount of organisational learning and contingency planning. It is therefore typically better to have two or four scenarios, avoiding an easy mid-point. It does not matter if the scenarios do not come to pass: the value lies in the process of exploration and contingency planning that the scenarios set off.

## INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS

An industry is a group of firms producing products and services that are essentially the same. Examples are the automobile industry and the airline industry. Industries are also often described as ‘sectors’, especially in public services (e.g. the health sector or the education sector). Industries and sectors are often made up of several specific markets.

A market is a group of customers for specific products or services that are essentially the same (e.g. a particular geographical market). Thus the automobile industry has markets in North America, Europe and Asia, for example.

### Competitive forces – the Five Forces Framework

Porter’s Five Forces Framework helps identify the attractiveness of an industry in terms of five competitive forces: (i) threat of entry, (ii) threat of substitutes, (iii) power of buyers, (iv) power of suppliers and (v) extent of rivalry between competitors.

These five forces together constitute an industry’s ‘structure’ (see Figure 2.4), which is typically fairly stable. For Porter, an attractive industry structure is one that offers good profit potential. His essential message is that where the five forces are high, industries are not attractive to compete in. Excessive competitive rivalry, powerful buyers and suppliers and the threat of substitutes or new entrants will all combine to squeeze profitability.

Figure 2.4 The Five Forces Framework

#### Competitive rivalry

At the centre of five forces analysis is the rivalry between the existing players – ‘incumbents’ in an industry. The more competitive rivalry there is, the worse it is for incumbents. Competitive rivals are organisations with similar products and services aimed at the same customer group. In the European airline industry, Air France and British Airways are rivals; high-speed trains are a ‘substitute’ (see below).

Five factors tend to define the extent of rivalry in an industry or market:

- Competitor balance. Where competitors are of roughly equal size there is the danger of intensely rivalrous behaviour as one competitor attempts to gain dominance over others, through aggressive price cuts for example. Conversely, less rivalrous industries tend to have one or two dominant organisations, with the smaller players reluctant to challenge the larger ones directly (e.g. by focusing on niches to avoid the ‘attention’ of the domin ant companies).
- Industry growth rate. In situations of strong growth, an organisation can grow with the market, but in situations of low growth or decline, any growth is likely to be at the expense of a rival, and meet with fierce resistance.
- High fixed costs. Industries with high fixed costs, perhaps because they require high investments in capital equipment or initial research, tend to be highly rivalrous. Companies will seek to spread their costs (i.e. reduce unit costs) by increasing their volumes: to do so, they typically cut their prices, prompting competitors to do the same and thereby triggering price wars in which everyone in the industry suffers. Similarly, if extra capacity can only be added in large increments (as in many manufacturing sectors, for example a chemical or glass factory), the competitor making such an addition is likely to create short-term over-capacity in the industry, leading to increased competition to use capacity.
- High exit barriers. The existence of high barriers to exit – in other words, closure or disinvestment – tends to increase rivalry, especially in declining industries. Excess capacity persists and consequently incumbents fight to maintain market share. Exit barriers might be high for a variety of reasons: for example, high redundancy costs or high investment in specific assets such as plant and equipment which others would not buy.
- Low differentiation. In a commodity market, where products or services are poorly differentiated, rivalry is increased because there is little to stop customers switching between competitors and the only way to compete is on price.

#### The threat of entry

How easy it is to enter the industry influences the degree of competition. The greater the threat of entry, the worse it is for incumbents in an industry. An attractive industry has high barriers to entry in order to reduce the threat of new competitors.

Five important entry barriers are:

- Scale and experience. In some industries, economies of scale are extremely important: for example, in the production of automobiles or the advertising of fast-moving consumer goods. Once incumbents have reached large-scale production, it will be very expensive for new entrants to match them and until they reach a similar volume they will have higher unit costs. This scale effect is increased where there are high investment requirements for entry, for example research costs in pharmaceuticals or capital equipment costs in auto mobiles. Barriers to entry also come from experience curve effects that give incumbents a cost advantage because they have learnt how to do things more efficiently than an inexperienced new entrant could possibly do (see section 6.3.1). Until the new entrant has built up equivalent experience over time, it will tend to produce at higher cost.
- Access to supply or distribution channels. In many industries manufacturers have had control over supply and/or distribution channels. Sometimes this has been through direct ownership (vertical integration), sometimes just through customer or supplier loyalty. In some industries this barrier has been overcome by new entrants who have bypassed retail distributors and sold directly to consumers through e-commerce (e.g. Dell Computers and Amazon).
- Expected retaliation. If an organisation considering entering an industry believes that the retaliation of an existing firm will be so great as to prevent entry, or mean that entry would be too costly, this is also a barrier. Retaliation could take the form of a price war or a marketing blitz. Just the knowledge that incumbents are prepared to retaliate is often sufficiently discouraging to act as a barrier.
- Legislation or government action. Legal restraints on new entry vary from patent protection (e.g. pharmaceuticals), to regulation of markets (e.g. pension selling), through to direct government action (e.g. tariffs). Of course, organisations are vulnerable to new entrants if governments remove such protection, as has happened with deregulation of the airline industry.
- Differentiation. Differentiation means providing a product or service with higher perceived value than the competition; its importance will be discussed more fully in section 6.3.2. Cars are differentiated, for example, by quality and branding. Steel, by contrast, is by and large a commodity, undifferentiated and therefore sold by the tonne. Steel buyers will simply buy the cheapest. Differentiation reduces the threat of entry because of increasing customer loyalty.

#### The threat of substitutes

Substitutes are products or services that offer a similar benefit to an industry’s products or services, but have a different nature. The simple risk of substitution puts a cap on the prices that can be charged in an industry. Thus, although Eurostar has no direct competitors in terms of train services from Paris to London, the prices it can charge are ultimately limited by the cost of flights between the two cities.

There are two important points to bear in mind about substitutes:

- The price/performance ratio is critical to substitution threats. A substitute is still an effective threat even if more expensive, so long as it offers performance advantages that customers value. Thus aluminium is more expensive than steel, but its relative lightness and its resistance to corrosion give it an advantage in some automobile manufacturing applications. It is the ratio of price to performance that matters, rather than simple price.
- Extra-industry effects are the core of the substitution concept. Substitutes come from outside the incumbents’ industry and should not be confused with competitors’ threats from within the industry. The value of the substitution concept is to force managers to look outside their own industry to consider more distant threats and constraints.

#### The power of buyers

Buyers are the organisation’s immediate customers, not necessarily the ultimate consumers. If buyers are powerful, then they can demand cheap prices or product or service improvements.

Buyer power is likely to be high when some of the following three conditions prevail:

- Concentrated buyers. Where a few large customers account for the majority of sales, buyer power is increased. This is the case on items such as milk in the grocery sector in many European countries, where just a few retailers dominate the market.
- Low switching costs. Where buyers can easily switch between one supplier and another, they have a strong negotiating position and can squeeze suppliers who are desperate for their business.
- Buyer competition threat. If the buyer has the capability to supply itself, or if it has the possibility of acquiring such a capability, it tends to be powerful. In negotiation with its suppliers, it can raise the threat of doing the suppliers’ job themselves. This is called backward vertical integration (see section 7.5), moving back to sources of supply, and might occur if satisfactory prices or quality from suppliers cannot be obtained. For example, some steel companies have gained power over their iron ore suppliers as they have acquired iron ore sources for themselves.

It is very important that buyers are distinguished from ultimate consumers. Thus for companies like Procter & Gamble or Unilever (makers of shampoo, washing powders and so on), their buyers are retailers such as Carrefour or Tesco, not ordinary consumers.

#### The power of suppliers

Suppliers are those who supply the organisation with what it needs to produce the product or service. As well as fuel, raw materials and equipment, this can include labour and sources of finance. The factors increasing supplier power are the converse to those for buyer power.

Thus supplier power is likely to be high where there are:

- Concentrated suppliers. Where just a few producers dominate supply, suppliers have more power over buyers. The iron ore industry is now concentrated in the hands of three main producers, leaving the steel companies, still relatively fragmented, in a weak negotiating position for this essential raw material.
- High switching costs. If it is expensive or disruptive to move from one supplier to another, then the buyer becomes relatively dependent and correspondingly weak. Microsoft is a powerful supplier because of the high switching costs of moving from one operating system to another. Buyers are prepared to pay a premium to avoid the trouble, and Microsoft knows it.
- Supplier competition threat. Suppliers have increased power where they are able to cut out buyers who are acting as intermediaries. Thus airlines have been able to negotiate tough contracts with travel agencies as the rise of online booking has allowed them to create a direct route to customers. This is called forward vertical integration, moving up closer to the ultimate customer.

Most organisations have many suppliers, so it is necessary to concentrate the analysis on the most important ones or types. If their power is high, suppliers can capture all their buyers’ own potential profits simply by raising their prices. Star football players have succeeded in raising their rewards to astronomical levels, while even the leading football clubs – their ‘buyers’ struggle to make money.

#### Types of industry

Five forces analysis helps to identify four main types of industry structure. In practice, particular industries are typically not pure representatives of these types, but none the less it is helpful to have these broad categories in mind in order to compare the attractiveness of industries and likely broad patterns of competitive behaviour within them.

These four types are:

- Monopolistic industries. A monopoly is formally an industry with just one firm and therefore no competitive rivalry. Because of the lack of choice between rivals, there is potentially very great power over buyers and suppliers. This can be very profitable. Firms can still have monopolistic power where they are simply the dominant competitor: for example, Google’s 66 per cent share of the American search market gives it price-setting power in the internet advertising market. Some industries are monopolistic because of economies of scale: water utility companies are often monopolies in a particular area because it is uneconomic for smaller players to compete. Other industries are monopolistic because of ‘network effects’, where a product is more valuable because of the number of other people using it: Facebook and Microsoft Office are so powerful precisely because so many friends and colleagues are already users.
- Oligopolistic industries. An oligopoly is where just a few firms dominate an industry, with the potential for limited rivalry and great power over buyers and suppliers. The iron ore market is an oligopoly, dominated by Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (see Illustration 2.3). Where there are just two oligopolistic rivals, as for Airbus and Boeing in the civil airline industry, the situation is a duopoly. In theory, oligopoly can be highly profitable, but much depends on the extent of rivalrous behaviour, the threat of entry and substitutes and the growth of final demand in key markets. Oligopolistic firms have a strong interest in minimising rivalry between each other so as to maintain a common front against buyers and suppliers.
- Hypercompetitive industries. Hypercompetition occurs where the frequency, boldness and aggression of competitor interactions accelerate to create a condition of constant disequilibrium and change. Under hypercompetition, rivals tend to invest heavily in destabilising innovation, expensive marketing initiatives and aggressive price cuts, with negative impacts on profits. Hypercompetition often breaks out in otherwise oligopolistic industries. Thus the global mobile phone industry has some oligopolistic characteristics, with Nokia holding 27 per cent market share, Samsung 23 per cent and Apple 9 per cent in 2012. However, the industry is very dynamic: Apple only entered the industry in 2007, and Nokia has lost around 8 per cent of the market since then. Competitive moves under conditions of hypercompetition are discussed in section 6.4.2.
- Perfectly competitive industries. Perfect competition exists where barriers to entry are low, there are many equal rivals each with very similar products, and information about competitors is freely available. Few markets are absolutely perfectly competitive, but many are highly so. In these conditions, firms are unable to earn more profit than the bare minimum required to survive. Competition focuses heavily on price, because competitors typically cannot fund major innovations or marketing initiatives. Minicab services in large cities often come close to perfect competition. Entrepreneurs should beware entering industries with low barriers to entry, as these are liable to be perfectly or highly competitive and good profits will be very hard to earn.

#### Key issues in using the five forces framework

The five forces framework has to be used carefully and is not necessarily complete, even at the industry level. When using this framework, it is important to bear the following three issues in mind:

- Defining the ‘right’ industry. Most industries can be analysed at different levels, for example different markets and even different segments within them (see section 2.4.2 below).
- Converging industries. Industry definition is often difficult too because industry boundaries are continuously changing. For example, many industries, especially in high-tech arenas, are converging. Convergence is where previously separate industries begin to overlap or merge in terms of activities, technologies, products and customers. Technological change has brought convergence between the telephone and photographic industries, for example, as mobile phones have come to include camera and video functions.
- Complementary organisations. Some analysts argue that industry analyses need to include a ‘sixth force’, the existence of organisations that are complementors rather than simple competitors. An organisation is your complementor if it enhances your business attractiveness to customers or suppliers.

### The dynamics of industry structure

This section examines two additional approaches to understanding change in industry structure: the industry life-cycle concept and comparative five forces analyses.

#### The industry life cycle

Figure 2.6 The industry life cycle

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.01.47.png)

The power of the five forces typically varies with the stages of the industry life cycle. The industry life-cycle concept proposes that industries start small in their development stage, then go through a period of rapid growth (the equivalent to ‘adolescence’ in the human life cycle), culminating in a period of ‘shake-out’. The final two stages are first a period of slow or even zero growth (‘maturity’), and then the final stage of decline (‘old age’). Each of these stages has implications for the five forces.

The development stage is an experimental one, typically with few players, little direct rivalry and highly differentiated products. The five forces are likely to be weak, therefore, though the next stage is one of high growth, with rivalry low as there is plenty of market opportunity for everybody. Low rivalry and keen buyers of the new product favour profits at this stage, but these are not certain. Barriers to entry may still be low in the growth stage, as existing competitors have not built up much scale, experience or customer loyalty. Suppliers can be powerful too if there is a shortage of components or materials that fast-growing businesses need for expansion.

The shake-out stage begins as the market becomes increasingly saturated and cluttered with competitors. Profits are variable, as increased rivalry forces the weakest competitors out of the business.

In the maturity stage, barriers to entry tend to increase, as control over distribution is established and economies of scale and experience curve benefits come into play. Products or services tend to standardise, with relative price becoming key. Buyers may become more powerful as they become less avid for the industry’s products and more confident in switching between suppliers. Profitability at the maturity stage relies on high market share, providing leverage against buyers and competitive advantage in terms of cost.

Finally, the decline stage can be a period of extreme rivalry, especially where there are high exit barriers, as falling sales force remaining competitors into dog-eat-dog competition. However, survivors in the decline stage may still be profitable if competitor exit leaves them in a monopolistic position.

It is important to avoid putting too much faith in the inevitability of life-cycle stages. One stage does not follow predictably after another: industries vary widely in the length of their growth stages, and others can rapidly ‘de-mature’ through radical innovation.

#### Comparative industry structure analyses

Figure 2.7 provides a framework for summarising the power of each of the five forces on five axes. Power diminishes as the axes go outwards. Where the forces are low, the total area enclosed by the lines between the axes is large; where the forces are high, the total area enclosed by the lines is small. The larger the enclosed area, therefore, the greater is the profit potential.

Notice too that if one of the forces is very adverse, then this might nullify positive assessments on the other four axes:

Figure 2.7 Comparative industry structure analysis

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.02.26.png)

For example, an industry with low rivalry, low substitution, low entry barriers and low supplier power might still be unattractive if powerful buyers were able to demand highly discounted prices. With these warnings in mind, such radar plots can none the less be both a useful device for initial analysis and an effective summary of a final, more refined analysis.

## COMPETITORS AND MARKETS

### Strategic groups

Strategic groups are organisations within an industry or sector with similar strategic characteristics, following similar strategies or competing on similar bases. These characteristics are different from those in other strategic groups in the same industry or sector. For example, in the grocery retailing industry, supermarkets, convenience stores and corner shops each form different strategic groups. There are many different characteristics that distinguish between strategic groups but these can be grouped into two major categories (see Figure 2.8).

First, the scope of an organisation’s activities (such as product range, geographical coverage and range of distribution channels used). Second, the resource commitment (such as brands, marketing spend and extent of vertical integration). Which characteristics are relevant differs from industry to industry, but typically important are those characteristics that separate high performers from low performers.

Figure 2.8 Some characteristics for identifying strategic groups

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.03.14.png)

Strategic groups can be mapped onto two-dimensional charts – for example, one axis might be the extent of product range and the other axis the size of marketing spend. One method for choosing key dimensions by which to map strategic groups is to identify top performers (by growth or profitability) in an industry and to compare them with low performers. Characteristics that are shared by top performers, but not by low performers, are likely to be particularly relevant for mapping strategic groups. For example, the most profitable firms in an industry might all be narrow in terms of product range, and lavish in terms of marketing spend, while the less profitable firms might be more widely spread in terms of products and restrained in their marketing. Here the two dimensions for mapping would be product range and marketing spend. A potential recommendation for the less profitable firms would be to cut back their product range and boost their marketing.

### Market segments

The concept of strategic groups discussed above helps with understanding the similarities and differences in terms of competitor characteristics. The concept of market segment focuses on differences in customer needs. A market segment is a group of customers who have similar needs that are different from customer needs in other parts of the market. Where these customer groups are relatively small, such market segments are often called ‘niches’.

Two issues are particularly important in market segment analysis, therefore:

- Variation in customer needs. Focusing on customer needs that are highly distinctive from those typical in the market is one means of building a long-term segment strategy. Customer needs vary for a whole variety of reasons – some of which are identified in Table 2.1. Theoretically, any of these factors could be used to identify distinct market segments. However, the crucial bases of segmentation vary according to market.
- Specialisation within a market segment can also be an important basis for a successful segmentation strategy. This is sometimes called a ‘niche strategy’. Organisations that have built up most experience in servicing a particular market segment should not only have lower costs in so doing, but also have built relationships which may be difficult for others to break down. Experience and relationships are likely to protect a dominant position in a particular segment. However, precisely because customers value different things in different segments, specialised producers may find it very difficult to compete on a broader basis.

### Competitor analysis and ‘Blue Oceans’

A strategy canvas compares competitors according to their performance on key success factors in order to establish the extent of differentiation. Figure 2.10 shows a strategy canvas for three electrical components companies. The canvas highlights the following three features:

- Critical success factors ( CSFs) are those factors that either are particularly valued by customers (i.e. strategic customers) or provide a significant advantage in terms of cost. Critical success factors are therefore likely to be an important source of competitive advantage or disadvantage. Figure 2.10 identifies five established critical success factors in this electrical components market (cost, after-sales service, delivery reliability, technical quality and testing facilities). Note there is also a new sixth critical success factor, design advisory services, which will be discussed under the third subhead, value innovation.
- Value curves are a graphic depiction of how customers perceive competitors’ relative performance across the critical success factors. In Figure 2.10, companies A and B perform well on cost, service, reliability and quality, but less well on testing. They do not offer any design advice. They are poorly differentiated and occupy a space in the market where profits may be hard to get because of excessive rivalry between the two. Company C, on the other hand, has a radically different value curve, characteristic of a ‘value innovator’.
- Value innovation is the creation of new market space by excelling on established critical success factors on which competitors are performing badly and/or by creating new critical success factors representing previously unrecognised customer wants. Thus in Figure 2.10, company C is a value innovator in both senses. First, it excels on the established customer need of offering testing facilities for customers’ products using its components. Second, it offers a new and valued design service advising customers on how to integrate their components in order for them to create better products.

A value innovator is a company that competes in ‘Blue Oceans’. Blue Oceans are new market spaces where competition is minimised. 21 Blue Oceans contrast with ‘Red Oceans’, where industries are already well defined and rivalry is intense. Blue Oceans evoke wide empty seas. Red Oceans are associated with bloody competition and ‘red ink’, in other words financial losses. The Blue Ocean concept is thus useful for identifying potential spaces in the environment with little competition. These Blue Oceans are strategic gaps in the marketplace.

Figure 2.10 Strategy canvas for electrical components companies

![](../Strategy images/Screenshot 2021-02-15 at 19.05.23.png)

In Figure 2.10, company C’s strategy exemplifies two critical principles of Blue Ocean thinking: focus and divergence. First, company C focuses its efforts on just two factors, testing and design services, while maintaining only adequate performance on the other critical success factors where its competitors are already high performers. Second, it has created a value curve that significantly diverges from its competitors’ value curves, creating a substantial strategic gap, or Blue Ocean, in the areas of testing and design services. This is shrewd. For company C, beating companies A and B in the areas where they are performing well anyway would require major investment and likely provide little advantage given that customers are already highly satisfied.

## OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS

The techniques and concepts in this chapter should help in identifying environmental threats and opportunities, for instance:

- PESTEL analysis of the macro-environment might reveal threats and opportunities presented by technological change, or shifts in market demographics or such like factors.
- Identification of key drivers for change can help generate different scenarios for managerial discussion, some more threatening, others more favourable.
- Porter’s five forces analysis might, for example, identify a rise or fall in barriers to entry, or opportunities to reduce industry rivalry, perhaps by acquisition of competitors.
- Blue Ocean thinking might reveal where companies can create new market spaces; alternatively it could help identify success factors which new entrants might attack in order to turn ‘Blue Oceans’ into ‘Red Oceans’.
